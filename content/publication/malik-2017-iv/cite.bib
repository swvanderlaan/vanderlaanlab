 abstract = {Large artery atherosclerotic stroke (LAS) shows substantial
heritability not explained by previous genome-wide association
studies. Here, we explore the role of coding variation in LAS by
analyzing variants on the HumanExome BeadChip in a total of 3,127
cases and 9,778 controls from Europe, Australia, and South Asia.
We report on a nonsynonymous single-nucleotide variant in serpin
family A member 1 (SERPINA1) encoding alpha-1 antitrypsin [AAT;
p.V213A; P = 5.99E-9, odds ratio (OR) = 1.22] and confirm histone
deacetylase 9 (HDAC9) as a major risk gene for LAS with an
association in the 3'-UTR (rs2023938; P = 7.76E-7, OR = 1.28).
Using quantitative microscale thermophoresis, we show that M1
(A213) exhibits an almost twofold lower dissociation constant
with its primary target human neutrophil elastase (NE) in
lipoprotein-containing plasma, but not in lipid-free plasma.
Hydrogen/deuterium exchange combined with mass spectrometry
further revealed a significant difference in the global
flexibility of the two variants. The observed stronger
interaction with lipoproteins in plasma and reduced global
flexibility of the Val-213 variant most likely improve its local
availability and reduce the extent of proteolytic inactivation by
other proteases in atherosclerotic plaques. Our results indicate
that the interplay between AAT, NE, and lipoprotein particles is
modulated by the gate region around position 213 in AAT, far away
from the unaltered reactive center loop (357-360). Collectively,
our findings point to a functionally relevant balance between
lipoproteins, proteases, and AAT in atherosclerosis.},
