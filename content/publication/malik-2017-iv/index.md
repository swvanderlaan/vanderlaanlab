abstract: Large artery atherosclerotic stroke (LAS) shows substantial heritability
  not explained by previous genome-wide association studies. Here, we explore the
  role of coding variation in LAS by analyzing variants on the HumanExome BeadChip
  in a total of 3,127 cases and 9,778 controls from Europe, Australia, and South Asia.
  We report on a nonsynonymous single-nucleotide variant in serpin family A member
  1 (SERPINA1) encoding alpha-1 antitrypsin [AAT; p.V213A; P = 5.99E-9, odds ratio
  (OR) = 1.22] and confirm histone deacetylase 9 (HDAC9) as a major risk gene for
  LAS with an association in the 3'-UTR (rs2023938; P = 7.76E-7, OR = 1.28). Using
  quantitative microscale thermophoresis, we show that M1 (A213) exhibits an almost
  twofold lower dissociation constant with its primary target human neutrophil elastase
  (NE) in lipoprotein-containing plasma, but not in lipid-free plasma. Hydrogen/deuterium
  exchange combined with mass spectrometry further revealed a significant difference
  in the global flexibility of the two variants. The observed stronger interaction
  with lipoproteins in plasma and reduced global flexibility of the Val-213 variant
  most likely improve its local availability and reduce the extent of proteolytic
  inactivation by other proteases in atherosclerotic plaques. Our results indicate
  that the interplay between AAT, NE, and lipoprotein particles is modulated by the
  gate region around position 213 in AAT, far away from the unaltered reactive center
  loop (357-360). Collectively, our findings point to a functionally relevant balance
  between lipoproteins, proteases, and AAT in atherosclerosis.
