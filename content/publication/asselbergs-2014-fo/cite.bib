 abstract = {Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) are performed to find
associations between genetic variants (i.e. single-nucleotide
polymorphisms) and diseases. This review describes the basic
principles of GWAS. To date, GWAS have identified thousands of
genetic variants associated with complex diseases and biological
characteristics such as LDL cholesterol levels. GWAS can provide
important insights into the underlying mechanisms of complex
diseases and biological characteristics, thereby aiding the
development of biomarkers and potentially pinpointing novel drug
targets.},
