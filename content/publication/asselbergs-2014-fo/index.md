abstract: Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) are performed to find associations
  between genetic variants (i.e. single-nucleotide polymorphisms) and diseases. This
  review describes the basic principles of GWAS. To date, GWAS have identified thousands
  of genetic variants associated with complex diseases and biological characteristics
  such as LDL cholesterol levels. GWAS can provide important insights into the underlying
  mechanisms of complex diseases and biological characteristics, thereby aiding the
  development of biomarkers and potentially pinpointing novel drug targets.
