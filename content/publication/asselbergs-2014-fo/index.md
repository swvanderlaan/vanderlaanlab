abstract: Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) are performed to find
  associations between genetic variants (i.e. single-nucleotide polymorphisms)
  and diseases. This review describes the basic principles of GWAS. To date,
  GWAS have identified thousands of genetic variants associated with complex
  diseases and biological characteristics such as LDL cholesterol levels. GWAS
  can provide important insights into the underlying mechanisms of complex
  diseases and biological characteristics, thereby aiding the development of
  biomarkers and potentially pinpointing novel drug targets.
