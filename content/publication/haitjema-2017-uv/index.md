abstract: "BACKGROUND: As genome-wide association efforts, such as CARDIoGRAM
  and METASTROKE, are ongoing to reveal susceptibility loci for their underlying
  disease-atherosclerotic disease-identification of candidate genes explaining
  the associations of these loci has proven the main challenge. Many disease
  susceptibility loci colocalize with DNA regulatory elements, which influence
  gene expression through chromatin interactions. Therefore, the target genes of
  these regulatory elements can be considered candidate genes. Applying these
  biological principles, we used an alternative approach to annotate
  susceptibility loci and identify candidate genes for human atherosclerotic
  disease based on circular chromosome conformation capture followed by
  sequencing. METHODS AND RESULTS: In human monocytes and coronary endothelial
  cells, we generated 63 chromatin interaction data sets for 37 active DNA
  regulatory elements that colocalize with known susceptibility loci for
  coronary artery disease (CARDIoGRAMplusC4D) and large artery stroke
  (METASTROKE). By circular chromosome conformation capture followed by
  sequencing, we identified a physical 3-dimensional interaction with 326
  candidate genes expressed in at least 1 of these cell types, of which 294 have
  not been reported before. We highlight 16 genes based on expression
  quantitative trait loci. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings provide additional
  candidate-gene annotation for 37 disease susceptibility loci for human
  atherosclerotic disease that are of potential interest to better understand
  the complex pathophysiology of cardiovascular diseases."
