abstract: 'BACKGROUND: As genome-wide association efforts, such as CARDIoGRAM and
  METASTROKE, are ongoing to reveal susceptibility loci for their underlying disease-atherosclerotic
  disease-identification of candidate genes explaining the associations of these loci
  has proven the main challenge. Many disease susceptibility loci colocalize with
  DNA regulatory elements, which influence gene expression through chromatin interactions.
  Therefore, the target genes of these regulatory elements can be considered candidate
  genes. Applying these biological principles, we used an alternative approach to
  annotate susceptibility loci and identify candidate genes for human atherosclerotic
  disease based on circular chromosome conformation capture followed by sequencing.
  METHODS AND RESULTS: In human monocytes and coronary endothelial cells, we generated
  63 chromatin interaction data sets for 37 active DNA regulatory elements that colocalize
  with known susceptibility loci for coronary artery disease (CARDIoGRAMplusC4D) and
  large artery stroke (METASTROKE). By circular chromosome conformation capture followed
  by sequencing, we identified a physical 3-dimensional interaction with 326 candidate
  genes expressed in at least 1 of these cell types, of which 294 have not been reported
  before. We highlight 16 genes based on expression quantitative trait loci. CONCLUSIONS:
  Our findings provide additional candidate-gene annotation for 37 disease susceptibility
  loci for human atherosclerotic disease that are of potential interest to better
  understand the complex pathophysiology of cardiovascular diseases.'
