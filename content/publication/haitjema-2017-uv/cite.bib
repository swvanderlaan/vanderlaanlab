 abstract = {BACKGROUND: As genome-wide association efforts, such as
CARDIoGRAM and METASTROKE, are ongoing to reveal susceptibility
loci for their underlying disease-atherosclerotic
disease-identification of candidate genes explaining the
associations of these loci has proven the main challenge. Many
disease susceptibility loci colocalize with DNA regulatory
elements, which influence gene expression through chromatin
interactions. Therefore, the target genes of these regulatory
elements can be considered candidate genes. Applying these
biological principles, we used an alternative approach to
annotate susceptibility loci and identify candidate genes for
human atherosclerotic disease based on circular chromosome
conformation capture followed by sequencing. METHODS AND
RESULTS: In human monocytes and coronary endothelial cells, we
generated 63 chromatin interaction data sets for 37 active DNA
regulatory elements that colocalize with known susceptibility
loci for coronary artery disease (CARDIoGRAMplusC4D) and large
artery stroke (METASTROKE). By circular chromosome conformation
capture followed by sequencing, we identified a physical
3-dimensional interaction with 326 candidate genes expressed in
at least 1 of these cell types, of which 294 have not been
reported before. We highlight 16 genes based on expression
quantitative trait loci. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings provide
additional candidate-gene annotation for 37 disease
susceptibility loci for human atherosclerotic disease that are
of potential interest to better understand the complex
pathophysiology of cardiovascular diseases.},
