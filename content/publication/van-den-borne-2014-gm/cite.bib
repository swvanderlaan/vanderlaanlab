 abstract = {BACKGROUND: Leukotriene B4 (LTB4) has been associated with the
initiation and progression of atherosclerosis and abdominal
aortic aneurysm (AAA) formation. However, associations of LTB4
levels with tissue characteristics and adverse clinical outcome
of advanced atherosclerosis and AAA are scarcely studied. We
hypothesized that LTB4 levels are associated with a vulnerable
plaque phenotype and adverse clinical outcome. Furthermore, that
LTB4 levels are associated with inflammatory AAA and adverse
clinical outcome. METHODS: Atherosclerotic plaques and AAA
specimens were selected from two independent databases for LTB4
measurements. Plaques were isolated during carotid
endarterectomy from asymptomatic (n = 58) or symptomatic (n =
317) patients, classified prior to surgery. LTB4 levels were
measured without prior lipid extraction and levels were
corrected for protein content. LTB4 levels were related to
plaque phenotype, baseline patient characteristics and clinical
outcome within three years following surgery. Seven non-diseased
mammary artery specimens served as controls. AAA specimens were
isolated during open repair, classified as elective (n = 189),
symptomatic (n = 29) or ruptured (n = 23). LTB4 levels were
measured similar to the plaque measurements and were related to
tissue characteristics, baseline patient characteristics and
clinical outcome. Twenty-six non-diseased aortic specimens
served as controls. RESULTS: LTB4 levels corrected for protein
content were not significantly associated with histological
characteristics specific for vulnerable plaques or inflammatory
AAA as well as clinical presentation. Moreover, it could not
predict secondary manifestations independently investigated in
both databases. However, LTB4 levels were significantly lower in
controls compared to plaque (p = 0.025) or AAA (p = 0.017).
CONCLUSIONS: LTB4 levels were not associated with a vulnerable
plaque phenotype or inflammatory AAA or clinical presentation.
This study does not provide supportive evidence for a role of
LTB4 in atherosclerotic plaque destabilization or AAA expansion.
However, these data should be interpreted with care, since LTB4
measurements were performed without prior lipid extractions.},
