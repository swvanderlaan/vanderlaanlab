abstract: 'BACKGROUND: Leukotriene B4 (LTB4) has been associated with the initiation
  and progression of atherosclerosis and abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) formation.
  However, associations of LTB4 levels with tissue characteristics and adverse clinical
  outcome of advanced atherosclerosis and AAA are scarcely studied. We hypothesized
  that LTB4 levels are associated with a vulnerable plaque phenotype and adverse clinical
  outcome. Furthermore, that LTB4 levels are associated with inflammatory AAA and
  adverse clinical outcome. METHODS: Atherosclerotic plaques and AAA specimens were
  selected from two independent databases for LTB4 measurements. Plaques were isolated
  during carotid endarterectomy from asymptomatic (n = 58) or symptomatic (n = 317)
  patients, classified prior to surgery. LTB4 levels were measured without prior lipid
  extraction and levels were corrected for protein content. LTB4 levels were related
  to plaque phenotype, baseline patient characteristics and clinical outcome within
  three years following surgery. Seven non-diseased mammary artery specimens served
  as controls. AAA specimens were isolated during open repair, classified as elective
  (n = 189), symptomatic (n = 29) or ruptured (n = 23). LTB4 levels were measured
  similar to the plaque measurements and were related to tissue characteristics, baseline
  patient characteristics and clinical outcome. Twenty-six non-diseased aortic specimens
  served as controls. RESULTS: LTB4 levels corrected for protein content were not
  significantly associated with histological characteristics specific for vulnerable
  plaques or inflammatory AAA as well as clinical presentation. Moreover, it could
  not predict secondary manifestations independently investigated in both databases.
  However, LTB4 levels were significantly lower in controls compared to plaque (p
  = 0.025) or AAA (p = 0.017). CONCLUSIONS: LTB4 levels were not associated with a
  vulnerable plaque phenotype or inflammatory AAA or clinical presentation. This study
  does not provide supportive evidence for a role of LTB4 in atherosclerotic plaque
  destabilization or AAA expansion. However, these data should be interpreted with
  care, since LTB4 measurements were performed without prior lipid extractions.'
