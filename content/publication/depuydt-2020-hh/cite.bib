 abstract = {RATIONALE: Atherosclerotic lesions are known for their cellular
heterogeneity, yet the molecular complexity within the cells of
human plaques has not been fully assessed. OBJECTIVE: Using
single-cell transcriptomics and chromatin accessibility, we
gained a better understanding of the pathophysiology underlying
human atherosclerosis. METHODS AND RESULTS: We performed
single-cell RNA and single-cell ATAC sequencing on human carotid
atherosclerotic plaques to define the cells at play and
determine their transcriptomic and epigenomic characteristics.
We identified 14 distinct cell populations including endothelial
cells, smooth muscle cells, mast cells, B cells, myeloid cells,
and T cells and identified multiple cellular activation states
and suggested cellular interconversions. Within the endothelial
cell population, we defined subsets with angiogenic capacity
plus clear signs of endothelial to mesenchymal transition. CD4+
and CD8+ T cells showed activation-based subclasses, each with a
gradual decline from a cytotoxic to a more quiescent phenotype.
Myeloid cells included 2 populations of proinflammatory
macrophages showing IL (interleukin) 1B or TNF (tumor necrosis
factor) expression as well as a foam cell-like population
expressing TREM2 (triggering receptor expressed on myeloid cells
2) and displaying a fibrosis-promoting phenotype. ATACseq data
identified specific transcription factors associated with the
myeloid subpopulation and T cell cytokine profiles underlying
mutual activation between both cell types. Finally,
cardiovascular disease susceptibility genes identified using
public genome-wide association studies data were particularly
enriched in lesional macrophages, endothelial, and smooth muscle
cells. CONCLUSIONS: This study provides a transcriptome-based
cellular landscape of human atherosclerotic plaques and
highlights cellular plasticity and intercellular communication
at the site of disease. This detailed definition of cell
communities at play in atherosclerosis will facilitate
cell-based mapping of novel interventional targets with direct
functional relevance for the treatment of human disease.},
