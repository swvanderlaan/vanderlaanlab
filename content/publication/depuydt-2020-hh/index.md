abstract: "RATIONALE: Atherosclerotic lesions are known for their cellular
  heterogeneity, yet the molecular complexity within the cells of human plaques
  has not been fully assessed. OBJECTIVE: Using single-cell transcriptomics and
  chromatin accessibility, we gained a better understanding of the
  pathophysiology underlying human atherosclerosis. METHODS AND RESULTS: We
  performed single-cell RNA and single-cell ATAC sequencing on human carotid
  atherosclerotic plaques to define the cells at play and determine their
  transcriptomic and epigenomic characteristics. We identified 14 distinct cell
  populations including endothelial cells, smooth muscle cells, mast cells, B
  cells, myeloid cells, and T cells and identified multiple cellular activation
  states and suggested cellular interconversions. Within the endothelial cell
  population, we defined subsets with angiogenic capacity plus clear signs of
  endothelial to mesenchymal transition. CD4+ and CD8+ T cells showed
  activation-based subclasses, each with a gradual decline from a cytotoxic to a
  more quiescent phenotype. Myeloid cells included 2 populations of
  proinflammatory macrophages showing IL (interleukin) 1B or TNF (tumor necrosis
  factor) expression as well as a foam cell-like population expressing TREM2
  (triggering receptor expressed on myeloid cells 2) and displaying a
  fibrosis-promoting phenotype. ATACseq data identified specific transcription
  factors associated with the myeloid subpopulation and T cell cytokine profiles
  underlying mutual activation between both cell types. Finally, cardiovascular
  disease susceptibility genes identified using public genome-wide association
  studies data were particularly enriched in lesional macrophages, endothelial,
  and smooth muscle cells. CONCLUSIONS: This study provides a
  transcriptome-based cellular landscape of human atherosclerotic plaques and
  highlights cellular plasticity and intercellular communication at the site of
  disease. This detailed definition of cell communities at play in
  atherosclerosis will facilitate cell-based mapping of novel interventional
  targets with direct functional relevance for the treatment of human disease."
