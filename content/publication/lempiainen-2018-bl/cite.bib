 abstract = {Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have identified over two
hundred chromosomal loci that modulate risk of coronary artery
disease (CAD). The genes affected by variants at these loci are
largely unknown and an untapped resource to improve our
understanding of CAD pathophysiology and identify potential
therapeutic targets. Here, we prioritized 68 genes as the most
likely causal genes at genome-wide significant loci identified by
GWAS of CAD and examined their regulatory roles in 286 metabolic
and vascular tissue gene-protein sub-networks (``modules''). The
modules and genes within were scored for CAD druggability
potential. The scoring enriched for targets of cardiometabolic
drugs currently in clinical use and in-depth analysis of the
top-scoring modules validated established and revealed novel
target tissues, biological processes, and druggable targets. This
study provides an unprecedented resource of tissue-defined
gene-protein interactions directly affected by genetic variance
in CAD risk loci.},
