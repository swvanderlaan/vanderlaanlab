abstract: Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have identified over two hundred
  chromosomal loci that modulate risk of coronary artery disease (CAD). The genes
  affected by variants at these loci are largely unknown and an untapped resource
  to improve our understanding of CAD pathophysiology and identify potential therapeutic
  targets. Here, we prioritized 68 genes as the most likely causal genes at genome-wide
  significant loci identified by GWAS of CAD and examined their regulatory roles in
  286 metabolic and vascular tissue gene-protein sub-networks (``modules''). The modules
  and genes within were scored for CAD druggability potential. The scoring enriched
  for targets of cardiometabolic drugs currently in clinical use and in-depth analysis
  of the top-scoring modules validated established and revealed novel target tissues,
  biological processes, and druggable targets. This study provides an unprecedented
  resource of tissue-defined gene-protein interactions directly affected by genetic
  variance in CAD risk loci.
