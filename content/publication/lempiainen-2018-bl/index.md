abstract: Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have identified over two
  hundred chromosomal loci that modulate risk of coronary artery disease (CAD).
  The genes affected by variants at these loci are largely unknown and an
  untapped resource to improve our understanding of CAD pathophysiology and
  identify potential therapeutic targets. Here, we prioritized 68 genes as the
  most likely causal genes at genome-wide significant loci identified by GWAS of
  CAD and examined their regulatory roles in 286 metabolic and vascular tissue
  gene-protein sub-networks (``modules''). The modules and genes within were
  scored for CAD druggability potential. The scoring enriched for targets of
  cardiometabolic drugs currently in clinical use and in-depth analysis of the
  top-scoring modules validated established and revealed novel target tissues,
  biological processes, and druggable targets. This study provides an
  unprecedented resource of tissue-defined gene-protein interactions directly
  affected by genetic variance in CAD risk loci.
