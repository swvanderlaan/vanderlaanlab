abstract: "BACKGROUND: Epidemiological studies show that high circulating
  cystatin C is associated with risk of cardiovascular disease (CVD),
  independent of creatinine-based renal function measurements. It is unclear
  whether this relationship is causal, arises from residual confounding, and/or
  is a consequence of reverse causation. OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study was
  to use Mendelian randomization to investigate whether cystatin C is causally
  related to CVD in the general population. METHODS: We incorporated participant
  data from 16 prospective cohorts (n = 76,481) with 37,126 measures of cystatin
  C and added genetic data from 43 studies (n = 252,216) with 63,292 CVD events.
  We used the common variant rs911119 in CST3 as an instrumental variable to
  investigate the causal role of cystatin C in CVD, including coronary heart
  disease, ischemic stroke, and heart failure. RESULTS: Cystatin C
  concentrations were associated with CVD risk after adjusting for age, sex, and
  traditional risk factors (relative risk: 1.82 per doubling of cystatin C; 95%
  confidence interval [CI]: 1.56 to 2.13; p = 2.12 $times$ 10(-14)). The minor
  allele of rs911119 was associated with decreased serum cystatin C (6.13% per
  allele; 95% CI: 5.75 to 6.50; p = 5.95 $times$ 10(-211)), explaining 2.8% of
  the observed variation in cystatin C. Mendelian randomization analysis did not
  provide evidence for a causal role of cystatin C, with a causal relative risk
  for CVD of 1.00 per doubling cystatin C (95% CI: 0.82 to 1.22; p = 0.994),
  which was statistically different from the observational estimate (p = 1.6
  $times$ 10(-5)). A causal effect of cystatin C was not detected for any
  individual component of CVD. CONCLUSIONS: Mendelian randomization analyses did
  not support a causal role of cystatin C in the etiology of CVD. As such,
  therapeutics targeted at lowering circulating cystatin C are unlikely to be
  effective in preventing CVD."
