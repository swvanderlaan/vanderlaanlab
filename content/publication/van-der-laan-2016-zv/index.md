abstract: 'BACKGROUND: Epidemiological studies show that high circulating cystatin
  C is associated with risk of cardiovascular disease (CVD), independent of creatinine-based
  renal function measurements. It is unclear whether this relationship is causal,
  arises from residual confounding, and/or is a consequence of reverse causation.
  OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study was to use Mendelian randomization to investigate
  whether cystatin C is causally related to CVD in the general population. METHODS:
  We incorporated participant data from 16 prospective cohorts (n = 76,481) with 37,126
  measures of cystatin C and added genetic data from 43 studies (n = 252,216) with
  63,292 CVD events. We used the common variant rs911119 in CST3 as an instrumental
  variable to investigate the causal role of cystatin C in CVD, including coronary
  heart disease, ischemic stroke, and heart failure. RESULTS: Cystatin C concentrations
  were associated with CVD risk after adjusting for age, sex, and traditional risk
  factors (relative risk: 1.82 per doubling of cystatin C; 95% confidence interval
  [CI]: 1.56 to 2.13; p = 2.12 $times$ 10(-14)). The minor allele of rs911119 was
  associated with decreased serum cystatin C (6.13% per allele; 95% CI: 5.75 to 6.50;
  p = 5.95 $times$ 10(-211)), explaining 2.8% of the observed variation in cystatin
  C. Mendelian randomization analysis did not provide evidence for a causal role of
  cystatin C, with a causal relative risk for CVD of 1.00 per doubling cystatin C
  (95% CI: 0.82 to 1.22; p = 0.994), which was statistically different from the observational
  estimate (p = 1.6 $times$ 10(-5)). A causal effect of cystatin C was not detected
  for any individual component of CVD. CONCLUSIONS: Mendelian randomization analyses
  did not support a causal role of cystatin C in the etiology of CVD. As such, therapeutics
  targeted at lowering circulating cystatin C are unlikely to be effective in preventing
  CVD.'
