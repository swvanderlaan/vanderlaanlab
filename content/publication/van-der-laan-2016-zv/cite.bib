 abstract = {BACKGROUND: Epidemiological studies show that high circulating
cystatin C is associated with risk of cardiovascular disease
(CVD), independent of creatinine-based renal function
measurements. It is unclear whether this relationship is causal,
arises from residual confounding, and/or is a consequence of
reverse causation. OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study was to use
Mendelian randomization to investigate whether cystatin C is
causally related to CVD in the general population. METHODS: We
incorporated participant data from 16 prospective cohorts (n =
76,481) with 37,126 measures of cystatin C and added genetic data
from 43 studies (n = 252,216) with 63,292 CVD events. We used the
common variant rs911119 in CST3 as an instrumental variable to
investigate the causal role of cystatin C in CVD, including
coronary heart disease, ischemic stroke, and heart failure.
RESULTS: Cystatin C concentrations were associated with CVD risk
after adjusting for age, sex, and traditional risk factors
(relative risk: 1.82 per doubling of cystatin C; 95% confidence
interval [CI]: 1.56 to 2.13; p = 2.12 $\times$ 10(-14)). The
minor allele of rs911119 was associated with decreased serum
cystatin C (6.13% per allele; 95% CI: 5.75 to 6.50; p = 5.95
$\times$ 10(-211)), explaining 2.8% of the observed variation in
cystatin C. Mendelian randomization analysis did not provide
evidence for a causal role of cystatin C, with a causal relative
risk for CVD of 1.00 per doubling cystatin C (95% CI: 0.82 to
1.22; p = 0.994), which was statistically different from the
observational estimate (p = 1.6 $\times$ 10(-5)). A causal effect
of cystatin C was not detected for any individual component of
CVD. CONCLUSIONS: Mendelian randomization analyses did not
support a causal role of cystatin C in the etiology of CVD. As
such, therapeutics targeted at lowering circulating cystatin C
are unlikely to be effective in preventing CVD.},
