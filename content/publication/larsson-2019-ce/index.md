abstract: "OBJECTIVE: To determine whether serum magnesium and calcium
  concentrations are causally associated with ischemic stroke or any of its
  subtypes using the mendelian randomization approach. METHODS: Analyses were
  conducted using summary statistics data for 13 single-nucleotide polymorphisms
  robustly associated with serum magnesium (n = 6) or serum calcium (n = 7)
  concentrations. The corresponding data for ischemic stroke were obtained from
  the MEGASTROKE consortium (34,217 cases and 404,630 noncases). RESULTS: In
  standard mendelian randomization analysis, the odds ratios for each 0.1 mmol/L
  (about 1 SD) increase in genetically predicted serum magnesium concentrations
  were 0.78 (95% confidence interval [CI] 0.69-0.89; p = 1.3 $times$ 10-4) for
  all ischemic stroke, 0.63 (95% CI 0.50-0.80; p = 1.6 $times$ 10-4) for
  cardioembolic stroke, and 0.60 (95% CI 0.44-0.82; p = 0.001) for large artery
  stroke; there was no association with small vessel stroke (odds ratio 0.90,
  95% CI 0.67-1.20; p = 0.46). Only the association with cardioembolic stroke
  was robust in sensitivity analyses. There was no association of genetically
  predicted serum calcium concentrations with all ischemic stroke (per 0.5 mg/dL
  [about 1 SD] increase in serum calcium: odds ratio 1.03, 95% CI 0.88-1.21) or
  with any subtype. CONCLUSIONS: This study found that genetically higher serum
  magnesium concentrations are associated with a reduced risk of cardioembolic
  stroke but found no significant association of genetically higher serum
  calcium concentrations with any ischemic stroke subtype."
