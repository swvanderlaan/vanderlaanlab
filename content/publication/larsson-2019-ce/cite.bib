 abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To determine whether serum magnesium and calcium
concentrations are causally associated with ischemic stroke or
any of its subtypes using the mendelian randomization approach.
METHODS: Analyses were conducted using summary statistics data
for 13 single-nucleotide polymorphisms robustly associated with
serum magnesium (n = 6) or serum calcium (n = 7) concentrations.
The corresponding data for ischemic stroke were obtained from
the MEGASTROKE consortium (34,217 cases and 404,630 noncases).
RESULTS: In standard mendelian randomization analysis, the odds
ratios for each 0.1 mmol/L (about 1 SD) increase in genetically
predicted serum magnesium concentrations were 0.78 (95%
confidence interval [CI] 0.69-0.89; p = 1.3 $\times$ 10-4) for
all ischemic stroke, 0.63 (95% CI 0.50-0.80; p = 1.6 $\times$
10-4) for cardioembolic stroke, and 0.60 (95% CI 0.44-0.82; p =
0.001) for large artery stroke; there was no association with
small vessel stroke (odds ratio 0.90, 95% CI 0.67-1.20; p =
0.46). Only the association with cardioembolic stroke was robust
in sensitivity analyses. There was no association of genetically
predicted serum calcium concentrations with all ischemic stroke
(per 0.5 mg/dL [about 1 SD] increase in serum calcium: odds
ratio 1.03, 95% CI 0.88-1.21) or with any subtype. CONCLUSIONS:
This study found that genetically higher serum magnesium
concentrations are associated with a reduced risk of
cardioembolic stroke but found no significant association of
genetically higher serum calcium concentrations with any
ischemic stroke subtype.},
