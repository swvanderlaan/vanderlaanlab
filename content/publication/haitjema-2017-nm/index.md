abstract: 'BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Haplogroup I, a common European paternal lineage of
  the Y chromosome, is associated with increased risk of coronary artery disease in
  British men. It is unclear whether this haplogroup or any other haplogroup on the
  Y chromosome is associated with histological characteristics of the diseased vessel
  wall in other vascular manifestations of cardiovascular diseases showing a male
  preponderance. METHODS: We examined Dutch men undergoing either carotid endarterectomy
  from the Athero-Express biobank (AE, n = 1217) or open aneurysm repair from the
  Aneurysm-Express biobank (AAA, n = 393). Upon resolving the Y chromosome phylogeny,
  each man was assigned to one of the paternal lineages based on combinations of single
  nucleotide polymorphisms of the male-specific region of the Y chromosome. We examined
  the associations between the Y chromosome and the histological characteristics of
  the carotid plaque and aneurysm wall, including lipid content, leukocyte infiltration
  and intraplaque haemorrhage, in all men. RESULTS: A majority of men were carriers
  of either haplogroup I (AE: 28% AAA: 24%) or haplogroup R (AE: 59% AAA: 61%). We
  found no association between Y chromosomal haplogroups and histological characteristics
  of plaque collected from carotid arteries or tissue specimens of aneurysms. Moreover,
  the distribution of frequency for all Y chromosomal haplogroups in both cohorts
  was similar to that of a general population of Dutch men. CONCLUSIONS: Our data
  show that genetic variation on the Y chromosome is not associated with histological
  characteristics of the plaques from carotid arteries or specimens of aneurysms in
  men of Dutch origin.'
