abstract: "BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Haplogroup I, a common European paternal lineage
  of the Y chromosome, is associated with increased risk of coronary artery
  disease in British men. It is unclear whether this haplogroup or any other
  haplogroup on the Y chromosome is associated with histological characteristics
  of the diseased vessel wall in other vascular manifestations of cardiovascular
  diseases showing a male preponderance. METHODS: We examined Dutch men
  undergoing either carotid endarterectomy from the Athero-Express biobank (AE,
  n = 1217) or open aneurysm repair from the Aneurysm-Express biobank (AAA, n =
  393). Upon resolving the Y chromosome phylogeny, each man was assigned to one
  of the paternal lineages based on combinations of single nucleotide
  polymorphisms of the male-specific region of the Y chromosome. We examined the
  associations between the Y chromosome and the histological characteristics of
  the carotid plaque and aneurysm wall, including lipid content, leukocyte
  infiltration and intraplaque haemorrhage, in all men. RESULTS: A majority of
  men were carriers of either haplogroup I (AE: 28% AAA: 24%) or haplogroup R
  (AE: 59% AAA: 61%). We found no association between Y chromosomal haplogroups
  and histological characteristics of plaque collected from carotid arteries or
  tissue specimens of aneurysms. Moreover, the distribution of frequency for all
  Y chromosomal haplogroups in both cohorts was similar to that of a general
  population of Dutch men. CONCLUSIONS: Our data show that genetic variation on
  the Y chromosome is not associated with histological characteristics of the
  plaques from carotid arteries or specimens of aneurysms in men of Dutch
  origin."
