 abstract = {BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Haplogroup I, a common European paternal
lineage of the Y chromosome, is associated with increased risk of
coronary artery disease in British men. It is unclear whether
this haplogroup or any other haplogroup on the Y chromosome is
associated with histological characteristics of the diseased
vessel wall in other vascular manifestations of cardiovascular
diseases showing a male preponderance. METHODS: We examined Dutch
men undergoing either carotid endarterectomy from the
Athero-Express biobank (AE, n = 1217) or open aneurysm repair
from the Aneurysm-Express biobank (AAA, n = 393). Upon resolving
the Y chromosome phylogeny, each man was assigned to one of the
paternal lineages based on combinations of single nucleotide
polymorphisms of the male-specific region of the Y chromosome. We
examined the associations between the Y chromosome and the
histological characteristics of the carotid plaque and aneurysm
wall, including lipid content, leukocyte infiltration and
intraplaque haemorrhage, in all men. RESULTS: A majority of men
were carriers of either haplogroup I (AE: 28% AAA: 24%) or
haplogroup R (AE: 59% AAA: 61%). We found no association
between Y chromosomal haplogroups and histological
characteristics of plaque collected from carotid arteries or
tissue specimens of aneurysms. Moreover, the distribution of
frequency for all Y chromosomal haplogroups in both cohorts was
similar to that of a general population of Dutch men.
CONCLUSIONS: Our data show that genetic variation on the Y
chromosome is not associated with histological characteristics of
the plaques from carotid arteries or specimens of aneurysms in
men of Dutch origin.},
