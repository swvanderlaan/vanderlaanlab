abstract: 'BACKGROUND: Recent studies found an immune regulatory role for Y chromosome
  and a relationship between loss of Y chromosome (LOY) in blood cells and a higher
  risk of cancer and mortality. Given involvement of immune cells in atherosclerosis,
  we hypothesized that LOY is associated with the severity of atherosclerotic plaque
  characteristics and outcome in men undergoing carotid endarterectomy. METHODS AND
  RESULTS: LOY was quantified in blood and plaque from raw intensity genotyping data
  in men within the Athero-Express biobank study. Plaques were dissected, and the
  culprit lesions used for histology and the measurement of inflammatory proteins.
  We tested LOY for association with (inflammatory) atherosclerotic plaque phenotypes
  and cytokines and assessed the association of LOY with secondary events during 3-year
  follow-up. Of 366 patients with carotid endarterectomy, 61 exhibited some degree
  of LOY in blood. LOY was also present in atherosclerotic plaque lesions (n=8/242,
  3%). LOY in blood was negatively associated with age ($β$=-0.03/10 y; r2=0.07; P=1.6$times$10-7)
  but not with cardiovascular disease severity at baseline. LOY in blood was associated
  with a larger atheroma size (odds ratio, 2.15; 95% confidence interval, 1.06-4.76;
  P=0.04); however, this association was not significant after correction for multiple
  testing. LOY was independently associated with secondary major cardiovascular events
  (hazard ratio=2.28; 95% confidence interval, 1.11-4.67; P=0.02) in blood when corrected
  for confounders. CONCLUSIONS: In this hypothesis-generating study, LOY in blood
  is independently associated with secondary major cardiovascular events in a severely
  atherosclerotic population. Our data could indicate that LOY affects secondary outcome
  via other mechanisms than inflammation in the atherosclerotic plaque.'
