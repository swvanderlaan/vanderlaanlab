 abstract = {BACKGROUND: Recent studies found an immune regulatory role for Y
chromosome and a relationship between loss of Y chromosome (LOY)
in blood cells and a higher risk of cancer and mortality. Given
involvement of immune cells in atherosclerosis, we hypothesized
that LOY is associated with the severity of atherosclerotic
plaque characteristics and outcome in men undergoing carotid
endarterectomy. METHODS AND RESULTS: LOY was quantified in blood
and plaque from raw intensity genotyping data in men within the
Athero-Express biobank study. Plaques were dissected, and the
culprit lesions used for histology and the measurement of
inflammatory proteins. We tested LOY for association with
(inflammatory) atherosclerotic plaque phenotypes and cytokines
and assessed the association of LOY with secondary events during
3-year follow-up. Of 366 patients with carotid endarterectomy,
61 exhibited some degree of LOY in blood. LOY was also present
in atherosclerotic plaque lesions (n=8/242, 3%). LOY in blood
was negatively associated with age ($Î²$=-0.03/10 y; r2=0.07;
P=1.6$\times$10-7) but not with cardiovascular disease severity
at baseline. LOY in blood was associated with a larger atheroma
size (odds ratio, 2.15; 95% confidence interval, 1.06-4.76;
P=0.04); however, this association was not significant after
correction for multiple testing. LOY was independently
associated with secondary major cardiovascular events (hazard
ratio=2.28; 95% confidence interval, 1.11-4.67; P=0.02) in
blood when corrected for confounders. CONCLUSIONS: In this
hypothesis-generating study, LOY in blood is independently
associated with secondary major cardiovascular events in a
severely atherosclerotic population. Our data could indicate
that LOY affects secondary outcome via other mechanisms than
inflammation in the atherosclerotic plaque.},
