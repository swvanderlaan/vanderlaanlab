 abstract = {In many species, the offspring of related parents suffer reduced
reproductive success, a phenomenon known as inbreeding
depression. In humans, the importance of this effect has
remained unclear, partly because reproduction between close
relatives is both rare and frequently associated with
confounding social factors. Here, using genomic inbreeding
coefficients (FROH) for >1.4 million individuals, we show that
FROH is significantly associated (p < 0.0005) with apparently
deleterious changes in 32 out of 100 traits analysed. These
changes are associated with runs of homozygosity (ROH), but not
with common variant homozygosity, suggesting that genetic
variants associated with inbreeding depression are predominantly
rare. The effect on fertility is striking: FROH equivalent to
the offspring of first cousins is associated with a 55%
decrease [95% CI 44-66%] in the odds of having children.
Finally, the effects of FROH are confirmed within full-sibling
pairs, where the variation in FROH is independent of all
environmental confounding.},
