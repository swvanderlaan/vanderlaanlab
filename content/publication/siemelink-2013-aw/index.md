abstract: Advances in risk prediction are necessary to stem the tide of the
  increasing incidence of global cardiovascular disease. Newly discovered
  biomarkers are needed for primary and secondary prevention and will
  undoubtedly play a major role in drug development programs and monitoring of
  treatment efficacy. The combination of improved -omics technologies and the
  investigation of relatively untapped sources of biomarkers will likely result
  in risk algorithms that will add value on top of the traditional risk factors.
  New sources of biomarkers are being explored with encouraging results. These
  include microvesicles, microRNAs, circulating cells and atherosclerotic
  plaques. We will review these sources for their potential for new biomarkers.
  Furthermore, the major impact of advances in genetics on risk prediction and
  biomarker development programs will be discussed.
