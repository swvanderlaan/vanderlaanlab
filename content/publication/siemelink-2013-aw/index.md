abstract: Advances in risk prediction are necessary to stem the tide of the increasing
  incidence of global cardiovascular disease. Newly discovered biomarkers are needed
  for primary and secondary prevention and will undoubtedly play a major role in drug
  development programs and monitoring of treatment efficacy. The combination of improved
  -omics technologies and the investigation of relatively untapped sources of biomarkers
  will likely result in risk algorithms that will add value on top of the traditional
  risk factors. New sources of biomarkers are being explored with encouraging results.
  These include microvesicles, microRNAs, circulating cells and atherosclerotic plaques.
  We will review these sources for their potential for new biomarkers. Furthermore,
  the major impact of advances in genetics on risk prediction and biomarker development
  programs will be discussed.
