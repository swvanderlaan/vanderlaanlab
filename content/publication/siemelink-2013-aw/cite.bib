 abstract = {Advances in risk prediction are necessary to stem the tide of the
increasing incidence of global cardiovascular disease. Newly
discovered biomarkers are needed for primary and secondary
prevention and will undoubtedly play a major role in drug
development programs and monitoring of treatment efficacy. The
combination of improved -omics technologies and the investigation
of relatively untapped sources of biomarkers will likely result
in risk algorithms that will add value on top of the traditional
risk factors. New sources of biomarkers are being explored with
encouraging results. These include microvesicles, microRNAs,
circulating cells and atherosclerotic plaques. We will review
these sources for their potential for new biomarkers.
Furthermore, the major impact of advances in genetics on risk
prediction and biomarker development programs will be discussed.},
