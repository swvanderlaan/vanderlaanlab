abstract: "BACKGROUND: Studies examining the role of factor V Leiden among
  patients at higher risk of atherothrombotic events, such as those with
  established coronary heart disease (CHD), are lacking. Given that coagulation
  is involved in the thrombus formation stage on atherosclerotic plaque rupture,
  we hypothesized that factor V Leiden may be a stronger risk factor for
  atherothrombotic events in patients with established CHD. METHODS: We
  performed an individual-level meta-analysis including 25 prospective studies
  (18 cohorts, 3 case-cohorts, 4 randomized trials) from the GENIUS-CHD
  (Genetics of Subsequent Coronary Heart Disease) consortium involving patients
  with established CHD at baseline. Participating studies genotyped factor V
  Leiden status and shared risk estimates for the outcomes of interest using a
  centrally developed statistical code with harmonized definitions across
  studies. Cox proportional hazards regression models were used to obtain age-
  and sex-adjusted estimates. The obtained estimates were pooled using
  fixed-effect meta-analysis. The primary outcome was composite of myocardial
  infarction and CHD death. Secondary outcomes included any stroke, ischemic
  stroke, coronary revascularization, cardiovascular mortality, and all-cause
  mortality. RESULTS: The studies included 69 681 individuals of whom 3190
  (4.6%) were either heterozygous or homozygous (n=47) carriers of factor V
  Leiden. Median follow-up per study ranged from 1.0 to 10.6 years. A total of
  20 studies with 61 147 participants and 6849 events contributed to analyses of
  the primary outcome. Factor V Leiden was not associated with the combined
  outcome of myocardial infarction and CHD death (hazard ratio, 1.03 [95% CI,
  0.92-1.16]; I2=28%; P-heterogeneity=0.12). Subgroup analysis according to
  baseline characteristics or strata of traditional cardiovascular risk factors
  did not show relevant differences. Similarly, risk estimates for the secondary
  outcomes including stroke, coronary revascularization, cardiovascular
  mortality, and all-cause mortality were also close to identity. CONCLUSIONS:
  Factor V Leiden was not associated with increased risk of subsequent
  atherothrombotic events and mortality in high-risk participants with
  established and treated CHD. Routine assessment of factor V Leiden status is
  unlikely to improve atherothrombotic events risk stratification in this
  population."
