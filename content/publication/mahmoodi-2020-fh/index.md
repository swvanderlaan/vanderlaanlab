abstract: 'BACKGROUND: Studies examining the role of factor V Leiden among patients
  at higher risk of atherothrombotic events, such as those with established coronary
  heart disease (CHD), are lacking. Given that coagulation is involved in the thrombus
  formation stage on atherosclerotic plaque rupture, we hypothesized that factor V
  Leiden may be a stronger risk factor for atherothrombotic events in patients with
  established CHD. METHODS: We performed an individual-level meta-analysis including
  25 prospective studies (18 cohorts, 3 case-cohorts, 4 randomized trials) from the
  GENIUS-CHD (Genetics of Subsequent Coronary Heart Disease) consortium involving
  patients with established CHD at baseline. Participating studies genotyped factor
  V Leiden status and shared risk estimates for the outcomes of interest using a centrally
  developed statistical code with harmonized definitions across studies. Cox proportional
  hazards regression models were used to obtain age- and sex-adjusted estimates. The
  obtained estimates were pooled using fixed-effect meta-analysis. The primary outcome
  was composite of myocardial infarction and CHD death. Secondary outcomes included
  any stroke, ischemic stroke, coronary revascularization, cardiovascular mortality,
  and all-cause mortality. RESULTS: The studies included 69 681 individuals of whom
  3190 (4.6%) were either heterozygous or homozygous (n=47) carriers of factor V Leiden.
  Median follow-up per study ranged from 1.0 to 10.6 years. A total of 20 studies
  with 61 147 participants and 6849 events contributed to analyses of the primary
  outcome. Factor V Leiden was not associated with the combined outcome of myocardial
  infarction and CHD death (hazard ratio, 1.03 [95% CI, 0.92-1.16]; I2=28%; P-heterogeneity=0.12).
  Subgroup analysis according to baseline characteristics or strata of traditional
  cardiovascular risk factors did not show relevant differences. Similarly, risk estimates
  for the secondary outcomes including stroke, coronary revascularization, cardiovascular
  mortality, and all-cause mortality were also close to identity. CONCLUSIONS: Factor
  V Leiden was not associated with increased risk of subsequent atherothrombotic events
  and mortality in high-risk participants with established and treated CHD. Routine
  assessment of factor V Leiden status is unlikely to improve atherothrombotic events
  risk stratification in this population.'
