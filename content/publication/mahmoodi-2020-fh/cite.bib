 abstract = {BACKGROUND: Studies examining the role of factor V Leiden among
patients at higher risk of atherothrombotic events, such as
those with established coronary heart disease (CHD), are
lacking. Given that coagulation is involved in the thrombus
formation stage on atherosclerotic plaque rupture, we
hypothesized that factor V Leiden may be a stronger risk factor
for atherothrombotic events in patients with established CHD.
METHODS: We performed an individual-level meta-analysis
including 25 prospective studies (18 cohorts, 3 case-cohorts, 4
randomized trials) from the GENIUS-CHD (Genetics of Subsequent
Coronary Heart Disease) consortium involving patients with
established CHD at baseline. Participating studies genotyped
factor V Leiden status and shared risk estimates for the
outcomes of interest using a centrally developed statistical
code with harmonized definitions across studies. Cox
proportional hazards regression models were used to obtain age-
and sex-adjusted estimates. The obtained estimates were pooled
using fixed-effect meta-analysis. The primary outcome was
composite of myocardial infarction and CHD death. Secondary
outcomes included any stroke, ischemic stroke, coronary
revascularization, cardiovascular mortality, and all-cause
mortality. RESULTS: The studies included 69 681 individuals of
whom 3190 (4.6%) were either heterozygous or homozygous (n=47)
carriers of factor V Leiden. Median follow-up per study ranged
from 1.0 to 10.6 years. A total of 20 studies with 61 147
participants and 6849 events contributed to analyses of the
primary outcome. Factor V Leiden was not associated with the
combined outcome of myocardial infarction and CHD death (hazard
ratio, 1.03 [95% CI, 0.92-1.16]; I2=28%;
P-heterogeneity=0.12). Subgroup analysis according to baseline
characteristics or strata of traditional cardiovascular risk
factors did not show relevant differences. Similarly, risk
estimates for the secondary outcomes including stroke, coronary
revascularization, cardiovascular mortality, and all-cause
mortality were also close to identity. CONCLUSIONS: Factor V
Leiden was not associated with increased risk of subsequent
atherothrombotic events and mortality in high-risk participants
with established and treated CHD. Routine assessment of factor V
Leiden status is unlikely to improve atherothrombotic events
risk stratification in this population.},
