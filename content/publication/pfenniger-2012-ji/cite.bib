 abstract = {OBJECTIVE: Cx40 is a gap junction protein important for
cell-cell communication in the endothelium. Polymorphisms in the
promoter region of the human Cx40 gene, -44G>A and +71A>G, were
shown to reduce Cx40 transcription by half. As mice with an
endothelial-specific deletion of Cx40 are more susceptible to
atherosclerosis, this study was designed to discover a
correlation between these polymorphisms and atherosclerosis in
European populations. METHODS AND RESULTS: 803 patients referred
to the Geneva University Hospitals for elective coronary
angiography were divided according to the number of
significantly stenosed vessels (from 0 to 3) and were genotyped
for the Cx40 polymorphisms. Genotype distribution in the control
group was -44GG/+71AA=59.8%, -44AG/+71AG=35.1% and
-44AA/+71GG=5.2%. Surprisingly, this distribution was similar
in the CAD group, with -44GG/+71AA=58.5%, -44AG/+71AG=37.6%
and -44AA/+71GG=3.8% (p=0.67). Moreover, no significant
association between histological carotid plaque composition of
culprit lesions and Cx40 polymorphisms could be detected in 583
Dutch patients of the Athero-Express study. CONCLUSIONS: Despite
a clear antiatherogenic role of Cx40 in mice, our study could
not detect an association of Cx40 promoter polymorphisms and CAD
in human. Moreover, a correlation with atherosclerotic plaque
stability or hypertension could not be demonstrated either.
Connexin polymorphisms affecting channel function may be of
greater importance for cardiovascular disease than polymorphisms
affecting the expression level of the protein.},
