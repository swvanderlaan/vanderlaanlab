abstract: "OBJECTIVE: Cx40 is a gap junction protein important for cell-cell
  communication in the endothelium. Polymorphisms in the promoter region of the
  human Cx40 gene, -44G>A and +71A>G, were shown to reduce Cx40 transcription by
  half. As mice with an endothelial-specific deletion of Cx40 are more
  susceptible to atherosclerosis, this study was designed to discover a
  correlation between these polymorphisms and atherosclerosis in European
  populations. METHODS AND RESULTS: 803 patients referred to the Geneva
  University Hospitals for elective coronary angiography were divided according
  to the number of significantly stenosed vessels (from 0 to 3) and were
  genotyped for the Cx40 polymorphisms. Genotype distribution in the control
  group was -44GG/+71AA=59.8%, -44AG/+71AG=35.1% and -44AA/+71GG=5.2%.
  Surprisingly, this distribution was similar in the CAD group, with
  -44GG/+71AA=58.5%, -44AG/+71AG=37.6% and -44AA/+71GG=3.8% (p=0.67). Moreover,
  no significant association between histological carotid plaque composition of
  culprit lesions and Cx40 polymorphisms could be detected in 583 Dutch patients
  of the Athero-Express study. CONCLUSIONS: Despite a clear antiatherogenic role
  of Cx40 in mice, our study could not detect an association of Cx40 promoter
  polymorphisms and CAD in human. Moreover, a correlation with atherosclerotic
  plaque stability or hypertension could not be demonstrated either. Connexin
  polymorphisms affecting channel function may be of greater importance for
  cardiovascular disease than polymorphisms affecting the expression level of
  the protein."
