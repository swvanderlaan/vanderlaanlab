abstract: 'OBJECTIVE: Cx40 is a gap junction protein important for cell-cell communication
  in the endothelium. Polymorphisms in the promoter region of the human Cx40 gene,
  -44G>A and +71A>G, were shown to reduce Cx40 transcription by half. As mice with
  an endothelial-specific deletion of Cx40 are more susceptible to atherosclerosis,
  this study was designed to discover a correlation between these polymorphisms and
  atherosclerosis in European populations. METHODS AND RESULTS: 803 patients referred
  to the Geneva University Hospitals for elective coronary angiography were divided
  according to the number of significantly stenosed vessels (from 0 to 3) and were
  genotyped for the Cx40 polymorphisms. Genotype distribution in the control group
  was -44GG/+71AA=59.8%, -44AG/+71AG=35.1% and -44AA/+71GG=5.2%. Surprisingly, this
  distribution was similar in the CAD group, with -44GG/+71AA=58.5%, -44AG/+71AG=37.6%
  and -44AA/+71GG=3.8% (p=0.67). Moreover, no significant association between histological
  carotid plaque composition of culprit lesions and Cx40 polymorphisms could be detected
  in 583 Dutch patients of the Athero-Express study. CONCLUSIONS: Despite a clear
  antiatherogenic role of Cx40 in mice, our study could not detect an association
  of Cx40 promoter polymorphisms and CAD in human. Moreover, a correlation with atherosclerotic
  plaque stability or hypertension could not be demonstrated either. Connexin polymorphisms
  affecting channel function may be of greater importance for cardiovascular disease
  than polymorphisms affecting the expression level of the protein.'
