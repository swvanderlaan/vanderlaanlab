 abstract = {BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Recent genome-wide association studies
identified the histone deacetylase 9 (HDAC9) gene region as a
major risk locus for large-vessel stroke and coronary artery
disease. However, the mechanisms linking variants at this locus
to vascular risk are poorly understood. In this study, we
investigated the candidacy and directionality of HDAC9 in
atherosclerosis and analyzed associations between risk alleles at
7p21.1 and plaque characteristics. METHODS: Allele-dependent
expression of HDAC9 was analyzed in human peripheral blood
mononuclear cells of healthy donors. Effects of HDAC9 deficiency
on atherosclerotic plaques were investigated in 18- and
28-week-old ApoE(-/-) mice by histology and immunohistochemistry.
We further performed detailed plaque phenotyping and genotyping
of rs2107595, the lead single-nucleotide polymorphism for
large-vessel stroke, in carotid endarterectomy samples of 1858
subjects from the Athero-Express study. RESULTS: Gene expression
studies in peripheral blood mononuclear cells revealed increased
mRNA levels of HDAC9 but not of neighboring genes (TWIST1/FERD3L)
in risk allele carriers of rs2107595. Compared with
HDAC9(+/+)ApoE(-/-) mice, HDAC9(-/-)ApoE(-/-) mice exhibited
markedly reduced lesion sizes throughout atherosclerotic aortas
and significantly less advanced lesions. The proportion of
Mac3-positive macrophages was higher in plaques from
HDAC9(-/-)ApoE(-/-) mice, but this was largely because of a lower
proportion of advanced lesions. Analysis of human atherosclerotic
plaques revealed no association between rs2107595 and specific
plaque characteristics. CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest that
HDAC9 represents the disease-relevant gene at the stroke and
coronary artery disease risk locus on 7p21.1, and that risk
alleles in this region mediate their effects through increased
HDAC9 expression. Targeted inhibition of HDAC9 might be a viable
strategy to prevent atherosclerosis.},
