abstract: "BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Recent genome-wide association studies
  identified the histone deacetylase 9 (HDAC9) gene region as a major risk locus
  for large-vessel stroke and coronary artery disease. However, the mechanisms
  linking variants at this locus to vascular risk are poorly understood. In this
  study, we investigated the candidacy and directionality of HDAC9 in
  atherosclerosis and analyzed associations between risk alleles at 7p21.1 and
  plaque characteristics. METHODS: Allele-dependent expression of HDAC9 was
  analyzed in human peripheral blood mononuclear cells of healthy donors.
  Effects of HDAC9 deficiency on atherosclerotic plaques were investigated in
  18- and 28-week-old ApoE(-/-) mice by histology and immunohistochemistry. We
  further performed detailed plaque phenotyping and genotyping of rs2107595, the
  lead single-nucleotide polymorphism for large-vessel stroke, in carotid
  endarterectomy samples of 1858 subjects from the Athero-Express study.
  RESULTS: Gene expression studies in peripheral blood mononuclear cells
  revealed increased mRNA levels of HDAC9 but not of neighboring genes
  (TWIST1/FERD3L) in risk allele carriers of rs2107595. Compared with
  HDAC9(+/+)ApoE(-/-) mice, HDAC9(-/-)ApoE(-/-) mice exhibited markedly reduced
  lesion sizes throughout atherosclerotic aortas and significantly less advanced
  lesions. The proportion of Mac3-positive macrophages was higher in plaques
  from HDAC9(-/-)ApoE(-/-) mice, but this was largely because of a lower
  proportion of advanced lesions. Analysis of human atherosclerotic plaques
  revealed no association between rs2107595 and specific plaque characteristics.
  CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest that HDAC9 represents the disease-relevant
  gene at the stroke and coronary artery disease risk locus on 7p21.1, and that
  risk alleles in this region mediate their effects through increased HDAC9
  expression. Targeted inhibition of HDAC9 might be a viable strategy to prevent
  atherosclerosis."
