abstract: 'BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Recent genome-wide association studies identified
  the histone deacetylase 9 (HDAC9) gene region as a major risk locus for large-vessel
  stroke and coronary artery disease. However, the mechanisms linking variants at
  this locus to vascular risk are poorly understood. In this study, we investigated
  the candidacy and directionality of HDAC9 in atherosclerosis and analyzed associations
  between risk alleles at 7p21.1 and plaque characteristics. METHODS: Allele-dependent
  expression of HDAC9 was analyzed in human peripheral blood mononuclear cells of
  healthy donors. Effects of HDAC9 deficiency on atherosclerotic plaques were investigated
  in 18- and 28-week-old ApoE(-/-) mice by histology and immunohistochemistry. We
  further performed detailed plaque phenotyping and genotyping of rs2107595, the lead
  single-nucleotide polymorphism for large-vessel stroke, in carotid endarterectomy
  samples of 1858 subjects from the Athero-Express study. RESULTS: Gene expression
  studies in peripheral blood mononuclear cells revealed increased mRNA levels of
  HDAC9 but not of neighboring genes (TWIST1/FERD3L) in risk allele carriers of rs2107595.
  Compared with HDAC9(+/+)ApoE(-/-) mice, HDAC9(-/-)ApoE(-/-) mice exhibited markedly
  reduced lesion sizes throughout atherosclerotic aortas and significantly less advanced
  lesions. The proportion of Mac3-positive macrophages was higher in plaques from
  HDAC9(-/-)ApoE(-/-) mice, but this was largely because of a lower proportion of
  advanced lesions. Analysis of human atherosclerotic plaques revealed no association
  between rs2107595 and specific plaque characteristics. CONCLUSIONS: Our results
  suggest that HDAC9 represents the disease-relevant gene at the stroke and coronary
  artery disease risk locus on 7p21.1, and that risk alleles in this region mediate
  their effects through increased HDAC9 expression. Targeted inhibition of HDAC9 might
  be a viable strategy to prevent atherosclerosis.'
