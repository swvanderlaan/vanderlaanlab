abstract: 'Aims: The effects of testosterone on cardiovascular disease (CVD) as reported
  in literature have been ambiguous. Recently, the interplay between testosterone
  and oestradiol as assessed by testosterone/oestradiol (T/E2) ratio was suggested
  to be better informative on the normal physiological balance. Considering the role
  in CVD, we hypothesized that a low T/E2 ratio in men with CVD is associated with
  increased inflammation, a more unstable plaque and a worse cardiovascular outcome.
  Methods and results: Testosterone and oestradiol concentrations were determined
  in blood samples of 611 male carotid endarterectomy patients included in the Athero-Express
  Biobank Study. T/E2 ratio was associated with baseline characteristics, atherosclerotic
  plaque specimens, inflammatory biomarkers, and 3 year follow-up information. Patients
  with low T/E2 ratio had more unfavourable inflammatory profiles compared with patients
  with high T/E2 as observed by higher levels of C-reactive protein [2.81 $μ$g/mL
  vs. 1.22 $μ$g/mL (P < 0.001)] and higher leucocyte counts [8.98*109/L vs. 7.75*109/L
  (P = 0.001)] in blood. In atherosclerotic plaques, a negative association between
  T/E2 ratio and number of neutrophils [B = -0.366 (P = 0.012)], plaque calcifications
  [OR: 0.816 (P = 0.044)], interleukin-6 (IL-6) [B = -0.15 (P = 0.009)], and IL-6
  receptor [B = -0.13 (P = 0.024)] was found. Furthermore, in multivariate Cox regression
  analysis, low T/E2 ratio was independently associated with an increased risk for
  major cardiovascular events (MACE) during 3 year follow-up [hazard ratio 1.67 (95%
  confidence interval 1.02-2.76), P = 0.043]. In men with elevated body mass index
  (BMI), these effects were strongest. Conclusion: In male patients with manifest
  atherosclerotic disease, low T/E2 ratio was associated with increased systemic inflammation,
  increased inflammatory plaque proteins, and an increased risk of future MACE as
  compared to men with normal T/E2 ratio. These effects are strongest in men with
  elevated BMI and are expected to be affected by aromatase activity in white fat
  tissues. Normalization of T/E2 ratio may be considered as target for the secondary
  prevention of CVD in men.'
