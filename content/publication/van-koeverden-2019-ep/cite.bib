 abstract = {Aims: The effects of testosterone on cardiovascular disease
(CVD) as reported in literature have been ambiguous. Recently,
the interplay between testosterone and oestradiol as assessed by
testosterone/oestradiol (T/E2) ratio was suggested to be better
informative on the normal physiological balance. Considering the
role in CVD, we hypothesized that a low T/E2 ratio in men with
CVD is associated with increased inflammation, a more unstable
plaque and a worse cardiovascular outcome. Methods and results:
Testosterone and oestradiol concentrations were determined in
blood samples of 611 male carotid endarterectomy patients
included in the Athero-Express Biobank Study. T/E2 ratio was
associated with baseline characteristics, atherosclerotic plaque
specimens, inflammatory biomarkers, and 3 year follow-up
information. Patients with low T/E2 ratio had more unfavourable
inflammatory profiles compared with patients with high T/E2 as
observed by higher levels of C-reactive protein [2.81 $μ$g/mL
vs. 1.22 $μ$g/mL (P < 0.001)] and higher leucocyte counts
[8.98*109/L vs. 7.75*109/L (P = 0.001)] in blood. In
atherosclerotic plaques, a negative association between T/E2
ratio and number of neutrophils [B = -0.366 (P = 0.012)], plaque
calcifications [OR: 0.816 (P = 0.044)], interleukin-6 (IL-6) [B
= -0.15 (P = 0.009)], and IL-6 receptor [B = -0.13 (P = 0.024)]
was found. Furthermore, in multivariate Cox regression analysis,
low T/E2 ratio was independently associated with an increased
risk for major cardiovascular events (MACE) during 3 year
follow-up [hazard ratio 1.67 (95% confidence interval
1.02-2.76), P = 0.043]. In men with elevated body mass index
(BMI), these effects were strongest. Conclusion: In male
patients with manifest atherosclerotic disease, low T/E2 ratio
was associated with increased systemic inflammation, increased
inflammatory plaque proteins, and an increased risk of future
MACE as compared to men with normal T/E2 ratio. These effects
are strongest in men with elevated BMI and are expected to be
affected by aromatase activity in white fat tissues.
Normalization of T/E2 ratio may be considered as target for the
secondary prevention of CVD in men.},
