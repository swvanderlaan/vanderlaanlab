 abstract = {AIMS: Mouse studies have established distinct monocyte subtypes
that participate in the process of atherosclerotic lesion
formation. The pro-inflammatory Ly6Chigh monocyte subtype
actively contributes to murine plaque progression and
destabilization. Also in humans, different peripheral monocyte
subtypes have been identified, of which the CD14+CD16- classical
monocyte is suggested to display similar pro-atherosclerotic
properties as the murine Ly6Chigh subtype. We aimed to
investigate if circulating CD14+CD16- classical monocytes
associate with characteristics of a vulnerable carotid
atherosclerotic plaque and if they associate with the risk of
secondary adverse manifestations of atherosclerotic disease.
METHODS AND RESULTS: We enrolled 175 carotid endarterectomy
patients of the Athero-Express biobank in our study. Just prior
to surgical procedure, blood was collected and peripheral blood
mononuclear cells were isolated. Characterization of monocyte
subsets was performed by flow cytometry. Plaque characteristics
were semi-quantitatively scored for the presence of fat,
collagen, intraplaque hemorrhage and calcification. Vessel
density, smooth muscle cells and macrophages were assessed
quantitatively on a continuous scale. All features of a
vulnerable plaque phenotype, including low amounts of collagen
and smooth muscle cells, and increased fat content, vessel
density, intraplaque hemorrhage and plaque macrophages were not
significantly associated with differential levels of peripheral
classical CD14+CD16- monocytes or other monocyte subsets. Using
Cox regression models to evaluate the prognostic value of
circulating monocyte subtypes, we found that total counts of
peripheral monocytes, as well as CD14+CD16- classical and other
monocyte subtypes were not associated with the risk of secondary
cardiovascular events during 3 years follow-up. CONCLUSION:
Circulating classical CD14+CD16- monocytes do not associate with
specific vulnerable plaque characteristics. In addition, they do
not predict secondary adverse manifestations. This suggests that
in patients with established carotid artery disease, the
circulating monocytes do not reflect plaque characteristics and
have no value in identifying patients at risk for future
cardiovascular events.},
