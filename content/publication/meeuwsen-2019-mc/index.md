abstract: "AIMS: Mouse studies have established distinct monocyte subtypes that
  participate in the process of atherosclerotic lesion formation. The
  pro-inflammatory Ly6Chigh monocyte subtype actively contributes to murine
  plaque progression and destabilization. Also in humans, different peripheral
  monocyte subtypes have been identified, of which the CD14+CD16- classical
  monocyte is suggested to display similar pro-atherosclerotic properties as the
  murine Ly6Chigh subtype. We aimed to investigate if circulating CD14+CD16-
  classical monocytes associate with characteristics of a vulnerable carotid
  atherosclerotic plaque and if they associate with the risk of secondary
  adverse manifestations of atherosclerotic disease. METHODS AND RESULTS: We
  enrolled 175 carotid endarterectomy patients of the Athero-Express biobank in
  our study. Just prior to surgical procedure, blood was collected and
  peripheral blood mononuclear cells were isolated. Characterization of monocyte
  subsets was performed by flow cytometry. Plaque characteristics were
  semi-quantitatively scored for the presence of fat, collagen, intraplaque
  hemorrhage and calcification. Vessel density, smooth muscle cells and
  macrophages were assessed quantitatively on a continuous scale. All features
  of a vulnerable plaque phenotype, including low amounts of collagen and smooth
  muscle cells, and increased fat content, vessel density, intraplaque
  hemorrhage and plaque macrophages were not significantly associated with
  differential levels of peripheral classical CD14+CD16- monocytes or other
  monocyte subsets. Using Cox regression models to evaluate the prognostic value
  of circulating monocyte subtypes, we found that total counts of peripheral
  monocytes, as well as CD14+CD16- classical and other monocyte subtypes were
  not associated with the risk of secondary cardiovascular events during 3 years
  follow-up. CONCLUSION: Circulating classical CD14+CD16- monocytes do not
  associate with specific vulnerable plaque characteristics. In addition, they
  do not predict secondary adverse manifestations. This suggests that in
  patients with established carotid artery disease, the circulating monocytes do
  not reflect plaque characteristics and have no value in identifying patients
  at risk for future cardiovascular events."
