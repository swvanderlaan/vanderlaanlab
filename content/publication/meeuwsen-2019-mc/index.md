abstract: 'AIMS: Mouse studies have established distinct monocyte subtypes that participate
  in the process of atherosclerotic lesion formation. The pro-inflammatory Ly6Chigh
  monocyte subtype actively contributes to murine plaque progression and destabilization.
  Also in humans, different peripheral monocyte subtypes have been identified, of
  which the CD14+CD16- classical monocyte is suggested to display similar pro-atherosclerotic
  properties as the murine Ly6Chigh subtype. We aimed to investigate if circulating
  CD14+CD16- classical monocytes associate with characteristics of a vulnerable carotid
  atherosclerotic plaque and if they associate with the risk of secondary adverse
  manifestations of atherosclerotic disease. METHODS AND RESULTS: We enrolled 175
  carotid endarterectomy patients of the Athero-Express biobank in our study. Just
  prior to surgical procedure, blood was collected and peripheral blood mononuclear
  cells were isolated. Characterization of monocyte subsets was performed by flow
  cytometry. Plaque characteristics were semi-quantitatively scored for the presence
  of fat, collagen, intraplaque hemorrhage and calcification. Vessel density, smooth
  muscle cells and macrophages were assessed quantitatively on a continuous scale.
  All features of a vulnerable plaque phenotype, including low amounts of collagen
  and smooth muscle cells, and increased fat content, vessel density, intraplaque
  hemorrhage and plaque macrophages were not significantly associated with differential
  levels of peripheral classical CD14+CD16- monocytes or other monocyte subsets. Using
  Cox regression models to evaluate the prognostic value of circulating monocyte subtypes,
  we found that total counts of peripheral monocytes, as well as CD14+CD16- classical
  and other monocyte subtypes were not associated with the risk of secondary cardiovascular
  events during 3 years follow-up. CONCLUSION: Circulating classical CD14+CD16- monocytes
  do not associate with specific vulnerable plaque characteristics. In addition, they
  do not predict secondary adverse manifestations. This suggests that in patients
  with established carotid artery disease, the circulating monocytes do not reflect
  plaque characteristics and have no value in identifying patients at risk for future
  cardiovascular events.'
