 abstract = {BACKGROUND: Genetic variation at chromosome 9p21 is a recognized
risk factor for coronary heart disease (CHD). However, its effect
on disease progression and subsequent events is unclear, raising
questions about its value for stratification of residual risk.
METHODS: A variant at chromosome 9p21 (rs1333049) was tested for
association with subsequent events during follow-up in 103 357
Europeans with established CHD at baseline from the GENIUS-CHD
(Genetics of Subsequent Coronary Heart Disease) Consortium
(73.1% male, mean age 62.9 years). The primary outcome,
subsequent CHD death or myocardial infarction (CHD
death/myocardial infarction), occurred in 13 040 of the 93 115
participants with available outcome data. Effect estimates were
compared with case/control risk obtained from the
CARDIoGRAMplusC4D consortium (Coronary Artery Disease Genome-wide
Replication and Meta-analysis [CARDIoGRAM] plus The Coronary
Artery Disease [C4D] Genetics) including 47 222 CHD cases and 122
264 controls free of CHD. RESULTS: Meta-analyses revealed no
significant association between chromosome 9p21 and the primary
outcome of CHD death/myocardial infarction among those with
established CHD at baseline (GENIUS-CHD odds ratio, 1.02; 95%
CI, 0.99-1.05). This contrasted with a strong association in
CARDIoGRAMPlusC4D odds ratio 1.20; 95% CI, 1.18-1.22; P for
interaction <0.001 compared with the GENIUS-CHD estimate.
Similarly, no clear associations were identified for additional
subsequent outcomes, including all-cause death, although we found
a modest positive association between chromosome 9p21 and
subsequent revascularization (odds ratio, 1.07; 95% CI,
1.04-1.09). CONCLUSIONS: In contrast to studies comparing
individuals with CHD to disease-free controls, we found no clear
association between genetic variation at chromosome 9p21 and risk
of subsequent acute CHD events when all individuals had CHD at
baseline. However, the association with subsequent
revascularization may support the postulated mechanism of
chromosome 9p21 for promoting atheroma development.},
