 abstract = {Hypoxia is prevalent in atherosclerotic plaques, promoting
plaque aggravation and subsequent cardiovascular disease (CVD).
Transmembrane protein carbonic anhydrase IX (CAIX) is
hypoxia-induced and can be shed into the circulation as soluble
CAIX (sCAIX). As plaque macrophages are hypoxic, we hypothesized
a role for CAIX in macrophage function, and as biomarker of
hypoxic plaque burden and CVD. As tumor patients with probable
CVD are treated with CAIX inhibitors, this study will shed light
on their safety profile. CAIX co-localized with macrophages
(CD68) and hypoxia (pimonidazole), and correlated with lipid
core size and pro-inflammatory iNOS+ macrophages in unstable
human carotid artery plaques. Although elevated pH and reduced
lactate levels in culture medium of CAIX knock-out (CAIXko)
macrophages confirmed its role as pH-regulator, only spare
respiratory capacity of CAIXko macrophages was reduced.
Proliferation, apoptosis, lipid uptake and expression of pro-
and anti-inflammatory genes were not altered. Plasma sCAIX
levels and plaque-resident CAIX were below the detection
threshold in 50 and 90% of asymptomatic and symptomatic cases,
respectively, while detectable levels did not associate with
primary or secondary events, or intraplaque hemorrhage. Initial
findings show that CAIX deficiency interferes with macrophage
metabolism. Despite a correlation with inflammatory macrophages,
plaque-resident and sCAIX expression levels are too low to serve
as biomarkers of future CVD.},
