abstract: Hypoxia is prevalent in atherosclerotic plaques, promoting plaque
  aggravation and subsequent cardiovascular disease (CVD). Transmembrane protein
  carbonic anhydrase IX (CAIX) is hypoxia-induced and can be shed into the
  circulation as soluble CAIX (sCAIX). As plaque macrophages are hypoxic, we
  hypothesized a role for CAIX in macrophage function, and as biomarker of
  hypoxic plaque burden and CVD. As tumor patients with probable CVD are treated
  with CAIX inhibitors, this study will shed light on their safety profile. CAIX
  co-localized with macrophages (CD68) and hypoxia (pimonidazole), and
  correlated with lipid core size and pro-inflammatory iNOS+ macrophages in
  unstable human carotid artery plaques. Although elevated pH and reduced
  lactate levels in culture medium of CAIX knock-out (CAIXko) macrophages
  confirmed its role as pH-regulator, only spare respiratory capacity of CAIXko
  macrophages was reduced. Proliferation, apoptosis, lipid uptake and expression
  of pro- and anti-inflammatory genes were not altered. Plasma sCAIX levels and
  plaque-resident CAIX were below the detection threshold in 50 and 90% of
  asymptomatic and symptomatic cases, respectively, while detectable levels did
  not associate with primary or secondary events, or intraplaque hemorrhage.
  Initial findings show that CAIX deficiency interferes with macrophage
  metabolism. Despite a correlation with inflammatory macrophages,
  plaque-resident and sCAIX expression levels are too low to serve as biomarkers
  of future CVD.
