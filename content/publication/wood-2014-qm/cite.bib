 abstract = {Using genome-wide data from 253,288 individuals, we identified
697 variants at genome-wide significance that together explained
one-fifth of the heritability for adult height. By testing
different numbers of variants in independent studies, we show
that the most strongly associated ∼2,000, ∼3,700 and ∼9,500 SNPs
explained ∼21%, ∼24% and ∼29% of phenotypic variance.
Furthermore, all common variants together captured 60% of
heritability. The 697 variants clustered in 423 loci were
enriched for genes, pathways and tissue types known to be
involved in growth and together implicated genes and pathways not
highlighted in earlier efforts, such as signaling by fibroblast
growth factors, WNT/$β$-catenin and chondroitin
sulfate-related genes. We identified several genes and pathways
not previously connected with human skeletal growth, including
mTOR, osteoglycin and binding of hyaluronic acid. Our results
indicate a genetic architecture for human height that is
characterized by a very large but finite number (thousands) of
causal variants.},
