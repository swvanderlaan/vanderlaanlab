 abstract = {Long-term measurements of CO(2) flux can be obtained using the
eddy covariance technique, but these datasets are affected by
gaps which hinder the estimation of robust long-term means and
annual ecosystem exchanges. We compare results obtained using
three gap-fill techniques: multiple regression (MR), multiple
imputation (MI), and artificial neural networks (ANNs), applied
to a one-year dataset of hourly CO(2) flux measurements
collected in Lutjewad, over a flat agriculture area near the
Wadden Sea dike in the north of the Netherlands. The dataset was
separated in two subsets: a learning and a validation set. The
performances of gap-filling techniques were analysed by
calculating statistical criteria: coefficient of determination
(R(2)), root mean square error (RMSE), mean absolute error
(MAE), maximum absolute error (MaxAE), and mean square bias
(MSB). The gap-fill accuracy is seasonally dependent, with
better results in cold seasons. The highest accuracy is obtained
using ANN technique which is also less sensitive to
environmental/seasonal conditions. We argue that filling gaps
directly on measured CO(2) fluxes is more advantageous than the
common method of filling gaps on calculated net ecosystem
change, because ANN is an empirical method and smaller scatter
is expected when gap filling is applied directly to
measurements.},
