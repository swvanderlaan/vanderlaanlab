abstract: 'Long-term measurements of CO(2) flux can be obtained using the eddy covariance
  technique, but these datasets are affected by gaps which hinder the estimation of
  robust long-term means and annual ecosystem exchanges. We compare results obtained
  using three gap-fill techniques: multiple regression (MR), multiple imputation (MI),
  and artificial neural networks (ANNs), applied to a one-year dataset of hourly CO(2)
  flux measurements collected in Lutjewad, over a flat agriculture area near the Wadden
  Sea dike in the north of the Netherlands. The dataset was separated in two subsets:
  a learning and a validation set. The performances of gap-filling techniques were
  analysed by calculating statistical criteria: coefficient of determination (R(2)),
  root mean square error (RMSE), mean absolute error (MAE), maximum absolute error
  (MaxAE), and mean square bias (MSB). The gap-fill accuracy is seasonally dependent,
  with better results in cold seasons. The highest accuracy is obtained using ANN
  technique which is also less sensitive to environmental/seasonal conditions. We
  argue that filling gaps directly on measured CO(2) fluxes is more advantageous than
  the common method of filling gaps on calculated net ecosystem change, because ANN
  is an empirical method and smaller scatter is expected when gap filling is applied
  directly to measurements.'
