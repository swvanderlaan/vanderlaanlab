 abstract = {BACKGROUND: The eicosanoid genes ALOX5, ALOX5AP and LTA4H have
been implicated in atherosclerosis. We assessed the impact of
common variants in these genes on gene expression, circulating
protein levels, and atherosclerotic plaque phenotypes. METHODS:
We included patients from the Stockholm Atherosclerosis Gene
Expression study (STAGE, N = 109), and the Athero-Express
Biobank Study (AE, N = 1443). We tested 1453 single-nucleotide
variants (SNVs) in ALOX5, ALOX5AP and LTA4H for association with
gene expression in STAGE. We also tested these SNVs for
association with seven histologically defined plaque phenotypes
in the AE (which included calcification, collagen, cellular
content, atheroma size, and intraplaque vessel density and
hemorrhage). RESULTS: We replicate a known cis-eQTL (rs6538697,
p = 1.96 $\times$ 10(-6)) for LTA4H expression in whole blood of
patients from STAGE. We found no significant association for any
of the SNVs tested with serum levels of ALOX5 or ALOX5AP (p >
5.79 $\times$ 10(-4)). For atherosclerotic plaque phenotypes the
strongest associations were found for intraplaque vessel density
and smooth muscle cells in the ALOX5AP locus (p > 1.67 $\times$
10(-4)). CONCLUSIONS: We replicate a known eQTL for LTA4H
expression in whole blood using STAGE data. We found no
associations of variants in and around ALOX5, ALOX5AP and LTA4H
with serum ALOX5 or ALOX5AP levels, or plaque phenotypes. On the
supposition that these genes play a causal role in
atherosclerosis, these results suggest that common variants in
these loci play a limited role (if any) in influencing advanced
atherosclerotic plaque morphology to the extent that it impacts
atherosclerotic disease.},
