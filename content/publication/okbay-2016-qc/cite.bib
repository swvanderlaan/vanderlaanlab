 abstract = {Very few genetic variants have been associated with depression
and neuroticism, likely because of limitations on sample size in
previous studies. Subjective well-being, a phenotype that is
genetically correlated with both of these traits, has not yet
been studied with genome-wide data. We conducted genome-wide
association studies of three phenotypes: subjective well-being (n
= 298,420), depressive symptoms (n = 161,460), and neuroticism (n
= 170,911). We identify 3 variants associated with subjective
well-being, 2 variants associated with depressive symptoms, and
11 variants associated with neuroticism, including 2 inversion
polymorphisms. The two loci associated with depressive symptoms
replicate in an independent depression sample. Joint analyses
that exploit the high genetic correlations between the phenotypes
(|$h̊o$^| $≈$ 0.8) strengthen the overall credibility of
the findings and allow us to identify additional variants. Across
our phenotypes, loci regulating expression in central nervous
system and adrenal or pancreas tissues are strongly enriched for
association.},
