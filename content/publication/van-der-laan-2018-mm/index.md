abstract: 'BACKGROUND: Atherosclerosis is a chronic inflammatory disease in part caused
  by lipid uptake in the vascular wall, but the exact underlying mechanisms leading
  to acute myocardial infarction and stroke remain poorly understood. Large consortia
  identified genetic susceptibility loci that associate with large artery ischemic
  stroke and coronary artery disease. However, deciphering their underlying mechanisms
  are challenging. Histological studies identified destabilizing characteristics in
  human atherosclerotic plaques that associate with clinical outcome. To what extent
  established susceptibility loci for large artery ischemic stroke and coronary artery
  disease relate to plaque characteristics is thus far unknown but may point to novel
  mechanisms. METHODS: We studied the associations of 61 established cardiovascular
  risk loci with 7 histological plaque characteristics assessed in 1443 carotid plaque
  specimens from the Athero-Express Biobank Study. We also assessed if the genotyped
  cardiovascular risk loci impact the tissue-specific gene expression in 2 independent
  biobanks, Biobank of Karolinska Endarterectomy and Stockholm Atherosclerosis Gene
  Expression. RESULTS: A total of 21 established risk variants (out of 61) nominally
  associated to a plaque characteristic. One variant (rs12539895, risk allele A) at
  7q22 associated to a reduction of intraplaque fat, P=5.09$times$10-6 after correction
  for multiple testing. We further characterized this 7q22 Locus and show tissue-specific
  effects of rs12539895 on HBP1 expression in plaques and COG5 expression in whole
  blood and provide data from public resources showing an association with decreased
  LDL (low-density lipoprotein) and increase HDL (high-density lipoprotein) in the
  blood. CONCLUSIONS: Our study supports the view that cardiovascular susceptibility
  loci may exert their effect by influencing the atherosclerotic plaque characteristics.'
