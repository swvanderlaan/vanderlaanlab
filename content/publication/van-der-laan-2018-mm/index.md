abstract: "BACKGROUND: Atherosclerosis is a chronic inflammatory disease in part
  caused by lipid uptake in the vascular wall, but the exact underlying
  mechanisms leading to acute myocardial infarction and stroke remain poorly
  understood. Large consortia identified genetic susceptibility loci that
  associate with large artery ischemic stroke and coronary artery disease.
  However, deciphering their underlying mechanisms are challenging. Histological
  studies identified destabilizing characteristics in human atherosclerotic
  plaques that associate with clinical outcome. To what extent established
  susceptibility loci for large artery ischemic stroke and coronary artery
  disease relate to plaque characteristics is thus far unknown but may point to
  novel mechanisms. METHODS: We studied the associations of 61 established
  cardiovascular risk loci with 7 histological plaque characteristics assessed
  in 1443 carotid plaque specimens from the Athero-Express Biobank Study. We
  also assessed if the genotyped cardiovascular risk loci impact the
  tissue-specific gene expression in 2 independent biobanks, Biobank of
  Karolinska Endarterectomy and Stockholm Atherosclerosis Gene Expression.
  RESULTS: A total of 21 established risk variants (out of 61) nominally
  associated to a plaque characteristic. One variant (rs12539895, risk allele A)
  at 7q22 associated to a reduction of intraplaque fat, P=5.09$times$10-6 after
  correction for multiple testing. We further characterized this 7q22 Locus and
  show tissue-specific effects of rs12539895 on HBP1 expression in plaques and
  COG5 expression in whole blood and provide data from public resources showing
  an association with decreased LDL (low-density lipoprotein) and increase HDL
  (high-density lipoprotein) in the blood. CONCLUSIONS: Our study supports the
  view that cardiovascular susceptibility loci may exert their effect by
  influencing the atherosclerotic plaque characteristics."
