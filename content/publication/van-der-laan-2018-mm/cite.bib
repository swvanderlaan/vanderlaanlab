 abstract = {BACKGROUND: Atherosclerosis is a chronic inflammatory disease in
part caused by lipid uptake in the vascular wall, but the exact
underlying mechanisms leading to acute myocardial infarction and
stroke remain poorly understood. Large consortia identified
genetic susceptibility loci that associate with large artery
ischemic stroke and coronary artery disease. However,
deciphering their underlying mechanisms are challenging.
Histological studies identified destabilizing characteristics in
human atherosclerotic plaques that associate with clinical
outcome. To what extent established susceptibility loci for
large artery ischemic stroke and coronary artery disease relate
to plaque characteristics is thus far unknown but may point to
novel mechanisms. METHODS: We studied the associations of 61
established cardiovascular risk loci with 7 histological plaque
characteristics assessed in 1443 carotid plaque specimens from
the Athero-Express Biobank Study. We also assessed if the
genotyped cardiovascular risk loci impact the tissue-specific
gene expression in 2 independent biobanks, Biobank of Karolinska
Endarterectomy and Stockholm Atherosclerosis Gene Expression.
RESULTS: A total of 21 established risk variants (out of 61)
nominally associated to a plaque characteristic. One variant
(rs12539895, risk allele A) at 7q22 associated to a reduction of
intraplaque fat, P=5.09$\times$10-6 after correction for
multiple testing. We further characterized this 7q22 Locus and
show tissue-specific effects of rs12539895 on HBP1 expression in
plaques and COG5 expression in whole blood and provide data from
public resources showing an association with decreased LDL
(low-density lipoprotein) and increase HDL (high-density
lipoprotein) in the blood. CONCLUSIONS: Our study supports the
view that cardiovascular susceptibility loci may exert their
effect by influencing the atherosclerotic plaque
characteristics.},
