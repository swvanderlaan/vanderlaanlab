 abstract = {Obesity is heritable and predisposes to many diseases. To
understand the genetic basis of obesity better, here we conduct a
genome-wide association study and Metabochip meta-analysis of
body mass index (BMI), a measure commonly used to define obesity
and assess adiposity, in up to 339,224 individuals. This analysis
identifies 97 BMI-associated loci (P 20% of BMI variation.
Pathway analyses provide strong support for a role of the central
nervous system in obesity susceptibility and implicate new genes
and pathways, including those related to synaptic function,
glutamate signalling, insulin secretion/action, energy
metabolism, lipid biology and adipogenesis.},
