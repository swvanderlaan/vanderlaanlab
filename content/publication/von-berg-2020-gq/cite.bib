 abstract = {Ischemic stroke (IS), caused by obstruction of cerebral blood
flow, is one of the leading causes of death. While neurologists
agree on delineation of IS into three subtypes (cardioembolic
stroke (CES), large artery stroke (LAS), and small vessel stroke
(SVS)), several subtyping systems exist. The most commonly used
systems are TOAST (Trial of Org 10172 in Acute Stroke Treatment)
and CCS (Causative Classification System for Stroke), but
agreement is only moderate. We have compared two approaches to
combining the existing subtyping systems for a phenotype suited
for a genome-wide association study (GWAS). We used the NINDS
Stroke Genetics Network dataset (SiGN, 11,477 cases with CCS and
TOAST subtypes and 28,026 controls). We defined two new
phenotypes: the intersect, for which an individual must be
assigned the same subtype by CCS and TOAST; and the union, for
which an individual must be assigned a subtype by either CCS or
TOAST. The union yields the largest sample size while the
intersect yields a phenotype with less potential
misclassification. We performed GWAS for all subtypes, using the
original subtyping systems, the intersect, and the union as
phenotypes. In each subtype, heritability was higher for the
intersect compared with the other phenotypes. We observed
stronger effects at known IS variants with the intersect
compared with the other phenotypes. With the intersect, we
identify rs10029218:G>A as an associated variant with SVS. We
conclude that this approach increases the likelihood to detect
genetic associations in ischemic stroke.},
