abstract: 'Ischemic stroke (IS), caused by obstruction of cerebral blood flow, is
  one of the leading causes of death. While neurologists agree on delineation of IS
  into three subtypes (cardioembolic stroke (CES), large artery stroke (LAS), and
  small vessel stroke (SVS)), several subtyping systems exist. The most commonly used
  systems are TOAST (Trial of Org 10172 in Acute Stroke Treatment) and CCS (Causative
  Classification System for Stroke), but agreement is only moderate. We have compared
  two approaches to combining the existing subtyping systems for a phenotype suited
  for a genome-wide association study (GWAS). We used the NINDS Stroke Genetics Network
  dataset (SiGN, 11,477 cases with CCS and TOAST subtypes and 28,026 controls). We
  defined two new phenotypes: the intersect, for which an individual must be assigned
  the same subtype by CCS and TOAST; and the union, for which an individual must be
  assigned a subtype by either CCS or TOAST. The union yields the largest sample size
  while the intersect yields a phenotype with less potential misclassification. We
  performed GWAS for all subtypes, using the original subtyping systems, the intersect,
  and the union as phenotypes. In each subtype, heritability was higher for the intersect
  compared with the other phenotypes. We observed stronger effects at known IS variants
  with the intersect compared with the other phenotypes. With the intersect, we identify
  rs10029218:G>A as an associated variant with SVS. We conclude that this approach
  increases the likelihood to detect genetic associations in ischemic stroke.'
