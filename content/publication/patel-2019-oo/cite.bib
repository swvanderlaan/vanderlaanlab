 abstract = {BACKGROUND: The Genetics of Subsequent Coronary Heart Disease
(GENIUS-CHD) consortium was established to facilitate discovery
and validation of genetic variants and biomarkers for risk of
subsequent CHD events, in individuals with established CHD.
METHODS: The consortium currently includes 57 studies from 18
countries, recruiting 185 614 participants with either acute
coronary syndrome, stable CHD, or a mixture of both at baseline.
All studies collected biological samples and followed-up study
participants prospectively for subsequent events. RESULTS:
Enrollment into the individual studies took place between 1985 to
present day with a duration of follow-up ranging from 9 months to
15 years. Within each study, participants with CHD are
predominantly of self-reported European descent (38%-100%),
mostly male (44%-91%) with mean ages at recruitment ranging
from 40 to 75 years. Initial feasibility analyses, using a
federated analysis approach, yielded expected associations
between age (hazard ratio, 1.15; 95% CI, 1.14-1.16) per 5-year
increase, male sex (hazard ratio, 1.17; 95% CI, 1.13-1.21) and
smoking (hazard ratio, 1.43; 95% CI, 1.35-1.51) with risk of
subsequent CHD death or myocardial infarction and differing
associations with other individual and composite cardiovascular
endpoints. CONCLUSIONS: GENIUS-CHD is a global collaboration
seeking to elucidate genetic and nongenetic determinants of
subsequent event risk in individuals with established CHD, to
improve residual risk prediction and identify novel drug targets
for secondary prevention. Initial analyses demonstrate the
feasibility and reliability of a federated analysis approach. The
consortium now plans to initiate and test novel hypotheses as
well as supporting replication and validation analyses for other
investigators.},
