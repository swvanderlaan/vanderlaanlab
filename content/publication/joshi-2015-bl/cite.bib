 abstract = {Homozygosity has long been associated with rare, often
devastating, Mendelian disorders, and Darwin was one of the first
to recognize that inbreeding reduces evolutionary fitness.
However, the effect of the more distant parental relatedness that
is common in modern human populations is less well understood.
Genomic data now allow us to investigate the effects of
homozygosity on traits of public health importance by observing
contiguous homozygous segments (runs of homozygosity), which are
inferred to be homozygous along their complete length. Given the
low levels of genome-wide homozygosity prevalent in most human
populations, information is required on very large numbers of
people to provide sufficient power. Here we use runs of
homozygosity to study 16 health-related quantitative traits in
354,224 individuals from 102 cohorts, and find statistically
significant associations between summed runs of homozygosity and
four complex traits: height, forced expiratory lung volume in one
second, general cognitive ability and educational attainment (P <
1 $\times$ 10(-300), 2.1 $\times$ 10(-6), 2.5 $\times$ 10(-10)
and 1.8 $\times$ 10(-10), respectively). In each case, increased
homozygosity was associated with decreased trait value,
equivalent to the offspring of first cousins being 1.2 cm shorter
and having 10 months' less education. Similar effect sizes were
found across four continental groups and populations with
different degrees of genome-wide homozygosity, providing evidence
that homozygosity, rather than confounding, directly contributes
to phenotypic variance. Contrary to earlier reports in
substantially smaller samples, no evidence was seen of an
influence of genome-wide homozygosity on blood pressure and low
density lipoprotein cholesterol, or ten other cardio-metabolic
traits. Since directional dominance is predicted for traits under
directional evolutionary selection, this study provides evidence
that increased stature and cognitive function have been
positively selected in human evolution, whereas many important
risk factors for late-onset complex diseases may not have been.},
