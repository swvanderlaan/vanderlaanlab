 abstract = {INTRODUCTION: Although plasma lipid levels are known to
influence the risk of cardiovascular disease (CVD), little is
known about their effect on atherosclerotic plaque composition.
To date, large-scale genome-wide association studies have
identified 157 common single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs)
that influence plasma lipid levels, providing a powerful tool to
investigate the effect of plasma lipid levels on atherosclerotic
plaque composition. METHODS: In this study, we included 1443
carotid endarterectomy patients from the Athero-Express Biobank
Study with genotype data. Plasma concentrations of high-density
lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C), low-density lipoprotein
cholesterol (LDL-C), total cholesterol (TC) and triglycerides
(TG) were determined at the time of endarterectomy.
Atherosclerotic plaques, obtained during surgery, were
histologically examined. For all patients, we calculated
weighted genetic burden scores (GBS) for all lipid traits on the
basis of the available genotype data. Plasma lipid levels and
GBS were tested for association with 7 histological features
using linear and logistic regression models. RESULTS: All GBS
were associated with their respective plasma lipid
concentrations (pHDL-C = 2.4 $\times$ 10(-14), pLDL-C = 0.003,
pTC = 2.1 $\times$ 10(-6), pTG = 3.4 $\times$ 10(-8)). Neither
the measured plasma lipids, nor the GBS, were associated with
histological features of atherosclerotic plaque composition. In
addition, neither the plasma lipids nor the GBS were associated
with clinical endpoints within 3 years of follow-up, with the
notable exception of a negative association between HDL-C and
composite cardiovascular endpoints. CONCLUSION: This study found
no evidence that plasma lipid levels or their genetic
determinants influence carotid plaque composition.},
