abstract: 'INTRODUCTION: Although plasma lipid levels are known to influence the risk
  of cardiovascular disease (CVD), little is known about their effect on atherosclerotic
  plaque composition. To date, large-scale genome-wide association studies have identified
  157 common single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) that influence plasma lipid levels,
  providing a powerful tool to investigate the effect of plasma lipid levels on atherosclerotic
  plaque composition. METHODS: In this study, we included 1443 carotid endarterectomy
  patients from the Athero-Express Biobank Study with genotype data. Plasma concentrations
  of high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C), low-density lipoprotein cholesterol
  (LDL-C), total cholesterol (TC) and triglycerides (TG) were determined at the time
  of endarterectomy. Atherosclerotic plaques, obtained during surgery, were histologically
  examined. For all patients, we calculated weighted genetic burden scores (GBS) for
  all lipid traits on the basis of the available genotype data. Plasma lipid levels
  and GBS were tested for association with 7 histological features using linear and
  logistic regression models. RESULTS: All GBS were associated with their respective
  plasma lipid concentrations (pHDL-C = 2.4 $times$ 10(-14), pLDL-C = 0.003, pTC =
  2.1 $times$ 10(-6), pTG = 3.4 $times$ 10(-8)). Neither the measured plasma lipids,
  nor the GBS, were associated with histological features of atherosclerotic plaque
  composition. In addition, neither the plasma lipids nor the GBS were associated
  with clinical endpoints within 3 years of follow-up, with the notable exception
  of a negative association between HDL-C and composite cardiovascular endpoints.
  CONCLUSION: This study found no evidence that plasma lipid levels or their genetic
  determinants influence carotid plaque composition.'
