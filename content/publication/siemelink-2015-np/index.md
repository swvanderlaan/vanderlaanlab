abstract: "INTRODUCTION: Although plasma lipid levels are known to influence the
  risk of cardiovascular disease (CVD), little is known about their effect on
  atherosclerotic plaque composition. To date, large-scale genome-wide
  association studies have identified 157 common single-nucleotide polymorphisms
  (SNPs) that influence plasma lipid levels, providing a powerful tool to
  investigate the effect of plasma lipid levels on atherosclerotic plaque
  composition. METHODS: In this study, we included 1443 carotid endarterectomy
  patients from the Athero-Express Biobank Study with genotype data. Plasma
  concentrations of high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C), low-density
  lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C), total cholesterol (TC) and triglycerides (TG)
  were determined at the time of endarterectomy. Atherosclerotic plaques,
  obtained during surgery, were histologically examined. For all patients, we
  calculated weighted genetic burden scores (GBS) for all lipid traits on the
  basis of the available genotype data. Plasma lipid levels and GBS were tested
  for association with 7 histological features using linear and logistic
  regression models. RESULTS: All GBS were associated with their respective
  plasma lipid concentrations (pHDL-C = 2.4 $times$ 10(-14), pLDL-C = 0.003, pTC
  = 2.1 $times$ 10(-6), pTG = 3.4 $times$ 10(-8)). Neither the measured plasma
  lipids, nor the GBS, were associated with histological features of
  atherosclerotic plaque composition. In addition, neither the plasma lipids nor
  the GBS were associated with clinical endpoints within 3 years of follow-up,
  with the notable exception of a negative association between HDL-C and
  composite cardiovascular endpoints. CONCLUSION: This study found no evidence
  that plasma lipid levels or their genetic determinants influence carotid
  plaque composition."
