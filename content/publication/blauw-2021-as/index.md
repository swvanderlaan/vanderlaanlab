abstract: We analyzed the effects of the common BMI-increasing melanocortin 4 receptor
  (MC4R) rs17782313-C allele with a minor allele frequency of 0.22-0.25 on (1) cardiovascular
  disease outcomes in two large population-based cohorts (Copenhagen City Heart Study
  and Copenhagen General Population Study, n = 106,018; and UK Biobank, n = 357,426)
  and additionally in an elderly population at risk for cardiovascular disease (n
  = 5241), and on (2) atherosclerotic plaque phenotypes in samples of patients who
  underwent endarterectomy (n = 1439). Using regression models, we additionally analyzed
  whether potential associations were modified by sex or explained by changes in body
  mass index. We confirmed the BMI-increasing effects of +0.22 kg/m2 per additional
  copy of the C allele (p < 0.001). However, we found no evidence for an association
  of common MC4R genetic variation with coronary artery disease (HR 1.03; 95% CI 0.99,
  1.07), ischemic vascular disease (HR 1.00; 95% CI 0.98, 1.03), myocardial infarction
  (HR 1.01; 95% CI 0.94, 1.08 and 1.02; 0.98, 1.07) or stroke (HR 0.93; 95% CI 0.85,
  1.01), nor with any atherosclerotic plaque phenotype. Thus, common MC4R genetic
  variation, despite increasing BMI, does not affect cardiovascular disease risk in
  the general population or in populations at risk for cardiovascular disease.
