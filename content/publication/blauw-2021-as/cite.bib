 abstract = {We analyzed the effects of the common BMI-increasing melanocortin
4 receptor (MC4R) rs17782313-C allele with a minor allele
frequency of 0.22-0.25 on (1) cardiovascular disease outcomes in
two large population-based cohorts (Copenhagen City Heart Study
and Copenhagen General Population Study, n = 106,018; and UK
Biobank, n = 357,426) and additionally in an elderly population
at risk for cardiovascular disease (n = 5241), and on (2)
atherosclerotic plaque phenotypes in samples of patients who
underwent endarterectomy (n = 1439). Using regression models, we
additionally analyzed whether potential associations were
modified by sex or explained by changes in body mass index. We
confirmed the BMI-increasing effects of +0.22 kg/m2 per
additional copy of the C allele (p < 0.001). However, we found no
evidence for an association of common MC4R genetic variation with
coronary artery disease (HR 1.03; 95% CI 0.99, 1.07), ischemic
vascular disease (HR 1.00; 95% CI 0.98, 1.03), myocardial
infarction (HR 1.01; 95% CI 0.94, 1.08 and 1.02; 0.98, 1.07) or
stroke (HR 0.93; 95% CI 0.85, 1.01), nor with any
atherosclerotic plaque phenotype. Thus, common MC4R genetic
variation, despite increasing BMI, does not affect cardiovascular
disease risk in the general population or in populations at risk
for cardiovascular disease.},
