abstract: "BACKGROUND AND AIMS: The atherosclerotic plaque microenvironment is
  highly complex, and selective agents that modulate plaque stability are not
  yet available. We sought to develop a scRNA-seq analysis workflow to
  investigate this environment and uncover potential therapeutic approaches. We
  designed a user-friendly, reproducible workflow that will be applicable to
  other disease-specific scRNA-seq datasets. METHODS: Here we incorporated
  automated cell labeling, pseudotemporal ordering, ligand-receptor evaluation,
  and drug-gene interaction analysis into a ready-to-deploy workflow. We applied
  this pipeline to further investigate a previously published human coronary
  single-cell dataset by Wirka et al. Notably, we developed an interactive web
  application to enable further exploration and analysis of this and other
  cardiovascular single-cell datasets. RESULTS: We revealed distinct derivations
  of fibroblast-like cells from smooth muscle cells (SMCs), and showed the key
  changes in gene expression along their de-differentiation path. We highlighted
  several key ligand-receptor interactions within the atherosclerotic
  environment through functional expression profiling and revealed several
  avenues for future pharmacological development for precision medicine.
  Further, our interactive web application, PlaqView (www.plaqview.com), allows
  lay scientists to explore this and other datasets and compare scRNA-seq tools
  without prior coding knowledge. CONCLUSIONS: This publicly available workflow
  and application will allow for more systematic and user-friendly analysis of
  scRNA datasets in other disease and developmental systems. Our analysis
  pipeline provides many hypothesis-generating tools to unravel the etiology of
  coronary artery disease. We also highlight potential mechanisms for several
  drugs in the atherosclerotic cellular environment. Future releases of PlaqView
  will feature more scRNA-seq and scATAC-seq atherosclerosis-related datasets to
  provide a critical resource for the field, and to promote data harmonization
  and biological interpretation."
