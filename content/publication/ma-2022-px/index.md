abstract: 'BACKGROUND AND AIMS: The atherosclerotic plaque microenvironment is highly
  complex, and selective agents that modulate plaque stability are not yet available.
  We sought to develop a scRNA-seq analysis workflow to investigate this environment
  and uncover potential therapeutic approaches. We designed a user-friendly, reproducible
  workflow that will be applicable to other disease-specific scRNA-seq datasets. METHODS:
  Here we incorporated automated cell labeling, pseudotemporal ordering, ligand-receptor
  evaluation, and drug-gene interaction analysis into a ready-to-deploy workflow.
  We applied this pipeline to further investigate a previously published human coronary
  single-cell dataset by Wirka et al. Notably, we developed an interactive web application
  to enable further exploration and analysis of this and other cardiovascular single-cell
  datasets. RESULTS: We revealed distinct derivations of fibroblast-like cells from
  smooth muscle cells (SMCs), and showed the key changes in gene expression along
  their de-differentiation path. We highlighted several key ligand-receptor interactions
  within the atherosclerotic environment through functional expression profiling and
  revealed several avenues for future pharmacological development for precision medicine.
  Further, our interactive web application, PlaqView (www.plaqview.com), allows lay
  scientists to explore this and other datasets and compare scRNA-seq tools without
  prior coding knowledge. CONCLUSIONS: This publicly available workflow and application
  will allow for more systematic and user-friendly analysis of scRNA datasets in other
  disease and developmental systems. Our analysis pipeline provides many hypothesis-generating
  tools to unravel the etiology of coronary artery disease. We also highlight potential
  mechanisms for several drugs in the atherosclerotic cellular environment. Future
  releases of PlaqView will feature more scRNA-seq and scATAC-seq atherosclerosis-related
  datasets to provide a critical resource for the field, and to promote data harmonization
  and biological interpretation.'
