 abstract = {BACKGROUND AND AIMS: The atherosclerotic plaque microenvironment
is highly complex, and selective agents that modulate plaque
stability are not yet available. We sought to develop a
scRNA-seq analysis workflow to investigate this environment and
uncover potential therapeutic approaches. We designed a
user-friendly, reproducible workflow that will be applicable to
other disease-specific scRNA-seq datasets. METHODS: Here we
incorporated automated cell labeling, pseudotemporal ordering,
ligand-receptor evaluation, and drug-gene interaction analysis
into a ready-to-deploy workflow. We applied this pipeline to
further investigate a previously published human coronary
single-cell dataset by Wirka et al. Notably, we developed an
interactive web application to enable further exploration and
analysis of this and other cardiovascular single-cell datasets.
RESULTS: We revealed distinct derivations of fibroblast-like
cells from smooth muscle cells (SMCs), and showed the key
changes in gene expression along their de-differentiation path.
We highlighted several key ligand-receptor interactions within
the atherosclerotic environment through functional expression
profiling and revealed several avenues for future
pharmacological development for precision medicine. Further, our
interactive web application, PlaqView (www.plaqview.com), allows
lay scientists to explore this and other datasets and compare
scRNA-seq tools without prior coding knowledge. CONCLUSIONS:
This publicly available workflow and application will allow for
more systematic and user-friendly analysis of scRNA datasets in
other disease and developmental systems. Our analysis pipeline
provides many hypothesis-generating tools to unravel the
etiology of coronary artery disease. We also highlight potential
mechanisms for several drugs in the atherosclerotic cellular
environment. Future releases of PlaqView will feature more
scRNA-seq and scATAC-seq atherosclerosis-related datasets to
provide a critical resource for the field, and to promote data
harmonization and biological interpretation.},
