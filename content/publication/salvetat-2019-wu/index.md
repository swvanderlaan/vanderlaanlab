abstract: Treatment-emergent depression is a common complication in patients with
  chronic hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection undergoing antiviral combination therapy
  with IFN-$α$ and ribavirin. It has recently been shown that changes in A-to-I RNA
  editing rates are associated with various pathologies such as inflammatory disorders,
  depression and suicide. Interestingly, IFN-$α$ induces gene expression of the RNA
  editing enzyme ADAR1-1 (ADAR1a-p150) and alters overall RNA editing activity. In
  this study, we took advantage of the high prevalence of pharmacologically induced
  depression in patients treated with IFN-$α$ and ribavirin to test the interest of
  RNA editing-related biomarkers in white blood cells of patients. In this 16-week
  longitudinal study, a small cohort of patients was clinically evaluated using standard
  assessment methods prior to and during antiviral therapy and blood samples were
  collected to analyse RNA editing modifications. A-I RNA editing activity on the
  phosphodiesterase 8A (PDE8A) gene, a previously identified RNA editing hotspot in
  the context of lupus erythematosus, was quantified by using an ultra-deep next-generation
  sequencing approach. We also monitored gene expression levels of the ADAR enzymes
  and the PDE8A gene during treatment by qPCR. As expected, psychiatric evaluation
  could track treatment-emergent depression, which occurred in 30% of HCV patients.
  We show that PDE8A RNA editing is increased in all patients following interferon
  treatment, but differently in 30% of patients. This effect was mimicked in a cellular
  model using SHSY-5Y neuroblastoma cells. By combining the data of A-I RNA editing
  and gene expression, we generated an algorithm that allowed discrimination between
  the group of patients who developed a treatment-emergent depression and those who
  did not. The current model of drug-induced depression identified A-I RNA editing
  biomarkers as useful tools for the identification of individuals at risk of developing
  depression in an objective, quantifiable biological blood test.
