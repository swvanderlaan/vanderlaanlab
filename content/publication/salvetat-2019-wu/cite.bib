 abstract = {Treatment-emergent depression is a common complication in
patients with chronic hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection
undergoing antiviral combination therapy with IFN-$α$ and
ribavirin. It has recently been shown that changes in A-to-I RNA
editing rates are associated with various pathologies such as
inflammatory disorders, depression and suicide. Interestingly,
IFN-$α$ induces gene expression of the RNA editing enzyme
ADAR1-1 (ADAR1a-p150) and alters overall RNA editing activity.
In this study, we took advantage of the high prevalence of
pharmacologically induced depression in patients treated with
IFN-$α$ and ribavirin to test the interest of RNA
editing-related biomarkers in white blood cells of patients. In
this 16-week longitudinal study, a small cohort of patients was
clinically evaluated using standard assessment methods prior to
and during antiviral therapy and blood samples were collected to
analyse RNA editing modifications. A-I RNA editing activity on
the phosphodiesterase 8A (PDE8A) gene, a previously identified
RNA editing hotspot in the context of lupus erythematosus, was
quantified by using an ultra-deep next-generation sequencing
approach. We also monitored gene expression levels of the ADAR
enzymes and the PDE8A gene during treatment by qPCR. As
expected, psychiatric evaluation could track treatment-emergent
depression, which occurred in 30% of HCV patients. We show that
PDE8A RNA editing is increased in all patients following
interferon treatment, but differently in 30% of patients. This
effect was mimicked in a cellular model using SHSY-5Y
neuroblastoma cells. By combining the data of A-I RNA editing
and gene expression, we generated an algorithm that allowed
discrimination between the group of patients who developed a
treatment-emergent depression and those who did not. The current
model of drug-induced depression identified A-I RNA editing
biomarkers as useful tools for the identification of individuals
at risk of developing depression in an objective, quantifiable
biological blood test.},
