 abstract = {Carotid artery intima media thickness (cIMT) and carotid plaque
are measures of subclinical atherosclerosis associated with
ischemic stroke and coronary heart disease (CHD). Here, we
undertake meta-analyses of genome-wide association studies
(GWAS) in 71,128 individuals for cIMT, and 48,434 individuals
for carotid plaque traits. We identify eight novel
susceptibility loci for cIMT, one independent association at the
previously-identified PINX1 locus, and one novel locus for
carotid plaque. Colocalization analysis with nearby vascular
expression quantitative loci (cis-eQTLs) derived from arterial
wall and metabolic tissues obtained from patients with CHD
identifies candidate genes at two potentially additional loci,
ADAMTS9 and LOXL4. LD score regression reveals significant
genetic correlations between cIMT and plaque traits, and both
cIMT and plaque with CHD, any stroke subtype and ischemic
stroke. Our study provides insights into genes and
tissue-specific regulatory mechanisms linking atherosclerosis
both to its functional genomic origins and its clinical
consequences in humans.},
