 abstract = {Background and Aims: Oncostatin M (OSM) signaling is implicated
in atherosclerosis, however the mechanism remains unclear. We
investigated the impact of common genetic variants in OSM and
its receptors, OSMR and LIFR, on overall plaque vulnerability,
plaque phenotype, intraplaque OSMR and LIFR expression, coronary
artery calcification burden and cardiovascular disease
susceptibility. Methods and Results: We queried Genotype-Tissue
Expression data and found that rs13168867 (C allele) was
associated with decreased OSMR expression and that rs10491509 (A
allele) was associated with increased LIFR expression in
arterial tissues. No variant was significantly associated with
OSM expression. We associated these two variants with plaque
characteristics from 1,443 genotyped carotid endarterectomy
patients in the Athero-Express Biobank Study. After correction
for multiple testing, rs13168867 was significantly associated
with an increased overall plaque vulnerability ($β$ = 0.118
$±$ s.e. = 0.040, p = 3.00 $\times$ 10-3, C allele). Looking
at individual plaque characteristics, rs13168867 showed
strongest associations with intraplaque fat ($β$ = 0.248
$±$ s.e. = 0.088, p = 4.66 $\times$ 10-3, C allele) and
collagen content ($β$ = -0.259 $±$ s.e. = 0.095, p = 6.22
$\times$ 10-3, C allele), but these associations were not
significant after correction for multiple testing. rs13168867
was not associated with intraplaque OSMR expression. Neither was
intraplaque OSMR expression associated with plaque vulnerability
and no known OSMR eQTLs were associated with coronary artery
calcification burden, or cardiovascular disease susceptibility.
No associations were found for rs10491509 in the LIFR locus.
Conclusions: Our study suggests that rs1316887 in the OSMR locus
is associated with increased plaque vulnerability, but not with
coronary calcification or cardiovascular disease risk. It
remains unclear through which precise biological mechanisms OSM
signaling exerts its effects on plaque morphology. However, the
OSM-OSMR/LIFR pathway is unlikely to be causally involved in
lifetime cardiovascular disease susceptibility.},
