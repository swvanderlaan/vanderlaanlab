abstract: 'Background and Aims: Oncostatin M (OSM) signaling is implicated in atherosclerosis,
  however the mechanism remains unclear. We investigated the impact of common genetic
  variants in OSM and its receptors, OSMR and LIFR, on overall plaque vulnerability,
  plaque phenotype, intraplaque OSMR and LIFR expression, coronary artery calcification
  burden and cardiovascular disease susceptibility. Methods and Results: We queried
  Genotype-Tissue Expression data and found that rs13168867 (C allele) was associated
  with decreased OSMR expression and that rs10491509 (A allele) was associated with
  increased LIFR expression in arterial tissues. No variant was significantly associated
  with OSM expression. We associated these two variants with plaque characteristics
  from 1,443 genotyped carotid endarterectomy patients in the Athero-Express Biobank
  Study. After correction for multiple testing, rs13168867 was significantly associated
  with an increased overall plaque vulnerability ($β$ = 0.118 $±$ s.e. = 0.040, p
  = 3.00 $times$ 10-3, C allele). Looking at individual plaque characteristics, rs13168867
  showed strongest associations with intraplaque fat ($β$ = 0.248 $±$ s.e. = 0.088,
  p = 4.66 $times$ 10-3, C allele) and collagen content ($β$ = -0.259 $±$ s.e. = 0.095,
  p = 6.22 $times$ 10-3, C allele), but these associations were not significant after
  correction for multiple testing. rs13168867 was not associated with intraplaque
  OSMR expression. Neither was intraplaque OSMR expression associated with plaque
  vulnerability and no known OSMR eQTLs were associated with coronary artery calcification
  burden, or cardiovascular disease susceptibility. No associations were found for
  rs10491509 in the LIFR locus. Conclusions: Our study suggests that rs1316887 in
  the OSMR locus is associated with increased plaque vulnerability, but not with coronary
  calcification or cardiovascular disease risk. It remains unclear through which precise
  biological mechanisms OSM signaling exerts its effects on plaque morphology. However,
  the OSM-OSMR/LIFR pathway is unlikely to be causally involved in lifetime cardiovascular
  disease susceptibility.'
