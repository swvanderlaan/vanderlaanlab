abstract: "Background and Aims: Oncostatin M (OSM) signaling is implicated in
  atherosclerosis, however the mechanism remains unclear. We investigated the
  impact of common genetic variants in OSM and its receptors, OSMR and LIFR, on
  overall plaque vulnerability, plaque phenotype, intraplaque OSMR and LIFR
  expression, coronary artery calcification burden and cardiovascular disease
  susceptibility. Methods and Results: We queried Genotype-Tissue Expression
  data and found that rs13168867 (C allele) was associated with decreased OSMR
  expression and that rs10491509 (A allele) was associated with increased LIFR
  expression in arterial tissues. No variant was significantly associated with
  OSM expression. We associated these two variants with plaque characteristics
  from 1,443 genotyped carotid endarterectomy patients in the Athero-Express
  Biobank Study. After correction for multiple testing, rs13168867 was
  significantly associated with an increased overall plaque vulnerability ($β$ =
  0.118 $±$ s.e. = 0.040, p = 3.00 $times$ 10-3, C allele). Looking at
  individual plaque characteristics, rs13168867 showed strongest associations
  with intraplaque fat ($β$ = 0.248 $±$ s.e. = 0.088, p = 4.66 $times$ 10-3, C
  allele) and collagen content ($β$ = -0.259 $±$ s.e. = 0.095, p = 6.22 $times$
  10-3, C allele), but these associations were not significant after correction
  for multiple testing. rs13168867 was not associated with intraplaque OSMR
  expression. Neither was intraplaque OSMR expression associated with plaque
  vulnerability and no known OSMR eQTLs were associated with coronary artery
  calcification burden, or cardiovascular disease susceptibility. No
  associations were found for rs10491509 in the LIFR locus. Conclusions: Our
  study suggests that rs1316887 in the OSMR locus is associated with increased
  plaque vulnerability, but not with coronary calcification or cardiovascular
  disease risk. It remains unclear through which precise biological mechanisms
  OSM signaling exerts its effects on plaque morphology. However, the
  OSM-OSMR/LIFR pathway is unlikely to be causally involved in lifetime
  cardiovascular disease susceptibility."
