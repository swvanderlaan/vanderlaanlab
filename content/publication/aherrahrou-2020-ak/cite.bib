 abstract = {RATIONALE: Coronary artery disease (CAD) is a major cause of
morbidity and mortality worldwide. Recent genome-wide
association studies revealed 163 loci associated with CAD.
However, the precise molecular mechanisms by which the majority
of these loci increase CAD risk are not known. Vascular smooth
muscle cells (VSMCs) are critical in the development of CAD.
They can play either beneficial or detrimental roles in lesion
pathogenesis, depending on the nature of their phenotypic
changes. OBJECTIVE: To identify genetic variants associated with
atherosclerosis-relevant phenotypes in VSMCs. METHODS AND
RESULTS: We quantified 12 atherosclerosis-relevant phenotypes
related to calcification, proliferation, and migration in VSMCs
isolated from 151 multiethnic heart transplant donors. After
genotyping and imputation, we performed association mapping
using 6.3 million genetic variants. We demonstrated significant
variations in calcification, proliferation, and migration. These
phenotypes were not correlated with each other. We performed
genome-wide association studies for 12 atherosclerosis-relevant
phenotypes and identified 4 genome-wide significant loci
associated with at least one VSMC phenotype. We overlapped the
previously identified CAD loci with our data set and found
nominally significant associations at 79 loci. One of them was
the chromosome 1q41 locus, which harbors MIA3. The G allele of
the lead risk single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) rs67180937
was associated with lower VSMC MIA3 expression and lower
proliferation. Lentivirus-mediated silencing of MIA3 (melanoma
inhibitory activity protein 3) in VSMCs resulted in lower
proliferation, consistent with human genetics findings.
Furthermore, we observed a significant reduction of MIA3 protein
in VSMCs in thin fibrous caps of late-stage atherosclerotic
plaques compared to early fibroatheroma with thick and
protective fibrous caps in mice and humans. CONCLUSIONS: Our
data demonstrate that genetic variants have significant
influences on VSMC function relevant to the development of
atherosclerosis. Furthermore, high MIA3 expression may promote
atheroprotective VSMC phenotypic transitions, including
increased proliferation, which is essential in the formation or
maintenance of a protective fibrous cap.},
