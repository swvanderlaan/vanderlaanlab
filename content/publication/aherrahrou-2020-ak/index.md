abstract: 'RATIONALE: Coronary artery disease (CAD) is a major cause of morbidity
  and mortality worldwide. Recent genome-wide association studies revealed 163 loci
  associated with CAD. However, the precise molecular mechanisms by which the majority
  of these loci increase CAD risk are not known. Vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs)
  are critical in the development of CAD. They can play either beneficial or detrimental
  roles in lesion pathogenesis, depending on the nature of their phenotypic changes.
  OBJECTIVE: To identify genetic variants associated with atherosclerosis-relevant
  phenotypes in VSMCs. METHODS AND RESULTS: We quantified 12 atherosclerosis-relevant
  phenotypes related to calcification, proliferation, and migration in VSMCs isolated
  from 151 multiethnic heart transplant donors. After genotyping and imputation, we
  performed association mapping using 6.3 million genetic variants. We demonstrated
  significant variations in calcification, proliferation, and migration. These phenotypes
  were not correlated with each other. We performed genome-wide association studies
  for 12 atherosclerosis-relevant phenotypes and identified 4 genome-wide significant
  loci associated with at least one VSMC phenotype. We overlapped the previously identified
  CAD loci with our data set and found nominally significant associations at 79 loci.
  One of them was the chromosome 1q41 locus, which harbors MIA3. The G allele of the
  lead risk single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) rs67180937 was associated with lower
  VSMC MIA3 expression and lower proliferation. Lentivirus-mediated silencing of MIA3
  (melanoma inhibitory activity protein 3) in VSMCs resulted in lower proliferation,
  consistent with human genetics findings. Furthermore, we observed a significant
  reduction of MIA3 protein in VSMCs in thin fibrous caps of late-stage atherosclerotic
  plaques compared to early fibroatheroma with thick and protective fibrous caps in
  mice and humans. CONCLUSIONS: Our data demonstrate that genetic variants have significant
  influences on VSMC function relevant to the development of atherosclerosis. Furthermore,
  high MIA3 expression may promote atheroprotective VSMC phenotypic transitions, including
  increased proliferation, which is essential in the formation or maintenance of a
  protective fibrous cap.'
