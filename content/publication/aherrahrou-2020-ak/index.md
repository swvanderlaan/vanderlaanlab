abstract: "RATIONALE: Coronary artery disease (CAD) is a major cause of
  morbidity and mortality worldwide. Recent genome-wide association studies
  revealed 163 loci associated with CAD. However, the precise molecular
  mechanisms by which the majority of these loci increase CAD risk are not
  known. Vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs) are critical in the development of
  CAD. They can play either beneficial or detrimental roles in lesion
  pathogenesis, depending on the nature of their phenotypic changes. OBJECTIVE:
  To identify genetic variants associated with atherosclerosis-relevant
  phenotypes in VSMCs. METHODS AND RESULTS: We quantified 12
  atherosclerosis-relevant phenotypes related to calcification, proliferation,
  and migration in VSMCs isolated from 151 multiethnic heart transplant donors.
  After genotyping and imputation, we performed association mapping using 6.3
  million genetic variants. We demonstrated significant variations in
  calcification, proliferation, and migration. These phenotypes were not
  correlated with each other. We performed genome-wide association studies for
  12 atherosclerosis-relevant phenotypes and identified 4 genome-wide
  significant loci associated with at least one VSMC phenotype. We overlapped
  the previously identified CAD loci with our data set and found nominally
  significant associations at 79 loci. One of them was the chromosome 1q41
  locus, which harbors MIA3. The G allele of the lead risk single nucleotide
  polymorphism (SNP) rs67180937 was associated with lower VSMC MIA3 expression
  and lower proliferation. Lentivirus-mediated silencing of MIA3 (melanoma
  inhibitory activity protein 3) in VSMCs resulted in lower proliferation,
  consistent with human genetics findings. Furthermore, we observed a
  significant reduction of MIA3 protein in VSMCs in thin fibrous caps of
  late-stage atherosclerotic plaques compared to early fibroatheroma with thick
  and protective fibrous caps in mice and humans. CONCLUSIONS: Our data
  demonstrate that genetic variants have significant influences on VSMC function
  relevant to the development of atherosclerosis. Furthermore, high MIA3
  expression may promote atheroprotective VSMC phenotypic transitions, including
  increased proliferation, which is essential in the formation or maintenance of
  a protective fibrous cap."
