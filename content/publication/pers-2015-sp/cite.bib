 abstract = {The main challenge for gaining biological insights from genetic
associations is identifying which genes and pathways explain the
associations. Here we present DEPICT, an integrative tool that
employs predicted gene functions to systematically prioritize the
most likely causal genes at associated loci, highlight enriched
pathways and identify tissues/cell types where genes from
associated loci are highly expressed. DEPICT is not limited to
genes with established functions and prioritizes relevant gene
sets for many phenotypes.},
