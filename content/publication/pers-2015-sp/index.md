abstract: The main challenge for gaining biological insights from genetic
  associations is identifying which genes and pathways explain the associations.
  Here we present DEPICT, an integrative tool that employs predicted gene
  functions to systematically prioritize the most likely causal genes at
  associated loci, highlight enriched pathways and identify tissues/cell types
  where genes from associated loci are highly expressed. DEPICT is not limited
  to genes with established functions and prioritizes relevant gene sets for
  many phenotypes.
