abstract: The main challenge for gaining biological insights from genetic associations
  is identifying which genes and pathways explain the associations. Here we present
  DEPICT, an integrative tool that employs predicted gene functions to systematically
  prioritize the most likely causal genes at associated loci, highlight enriched pathways
  and identify tissues/cell types where genes from associated loci are highly expressed.
  DEPICT is not limited to genes with established functions and prioritizes relevant
  gene sets for many phenotypes.
