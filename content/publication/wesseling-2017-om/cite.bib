 abstract = {BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Previously, we showed that patients
undergoing carotid endarterectomy have an increased risk for
major atherosclerotic events in the presence of moderate or poor
kidney function. Acceleration of vascular inflammatory responses
is considered to be causally involved in progression of
atherogenesis and poor outcome in chronic kidney disease
patients. The association between kidney function and plaque
composition has not been thoroughly investigated yet. The aim of
this study was to investigate the association between kidney
function and atherosclerotic plaque composition in patients
undergoing carotid endarterectomy. METHODS: Atherosclerotic
plaques, harvested from 1796 patients who underwent carotid
endarterectomy, were immunohistochemically stained for
macrophages, smooth muscle cells, calcifications, collagen,
microvessels, lipid core size and intraplaque hemorrhage.
Cytokines were measured in plaque and plasma and associated with
kidney function. Quantitative proteomics were performed on 40
carotid plaques and associated with kidney function. RESULTS:
Decreased kidney function was associated with increased odds
ratio of intraplaque hemorrhage, OR 1.15 (95% CI; 1.02-1.29 (p =
0.024)) and increased odds ratio of fibrous-atheromatous plaques
(plaques with lipid core presenting more than 10% of total
plaque surface) OR 1.21 (95% CI; 1.07-1.38 (p = 0.003)) per
decrease of 20 points in eGFR. Proteomics revealed that decreased
kidney function was associated with upregulation of the classical
pathway of the complement system and the intrinsic pathway of the
coagulation system. CONCLUSIONS: Decreased kidney function was
associated with plaque hemorrhage but not with inflammatory
plaque characteristics. Our data suggests that other pathways
than the inflammation-pathway are involved in plaque
vulnerability and poor outcome in patients with decreased kidney
function.},
