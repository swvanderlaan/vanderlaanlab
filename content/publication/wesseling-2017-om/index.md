abstract: "BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Previously, we showed that patients undergoing
  carotid endarterectomy have an increased risk for major atherosclerotic events
  in the presence of moderate or poor kidney function. Acceleration of vascular
  inflammatory responses is considered to be causally involved in progression of
  atherogenesis and poor outcome in chronic kidney disease patients. The
  association between kidney function and plaque composition has not been
  thoroughly investigated yet. The aim of this study was to investigate the
  association between kidney function and atherosclerotic plaque composition in
  patients undergoing carotid endarterectomy. METHODS: Atherosclerotic plaques,
  harvested from 1796 patients who underwent carotid endarterectomy, were
  immunohistochemically stained for macrophages, smooth muscle cells,
  calcifications, collagen, microvessels, lipid core size and intraplaque
  hemorrhage. Cytokines were measured in plaque and plasma and associated with
  kidney function. Quantitative proteomics were performed on 40 carotid plaques
  and associated with kidney function. RESULTS: Decreased kidney function was
  associated with increased odds ratio of intraplaque hemorrhage, OR 1.15 (95%
  CI; 1.02-1.29 (p = 0.024)) and increased odds ratio of fibrous-atheromatous
  plaques (plaques with lipid core presenting more than 10% of total plaque
  surface) OR 1.21 (95% CI; 1.07-1.38 (p = 0.003)) per decrease of 20 points in
  eGFR. Proteomics revealed that decreased kidney function was associated with
  upregulation of the classical pathway of the complement system and the
  intrinsic pathway of the coagulation system. CONCLUSIONS: Decreased kidney
  function was associated with plaque hemorrhage but not with inflammatory
  plaque characteristics. Our data suggests that other pathways than the
  inflammation-pathway are involved in plaque vulnerability and poor outcome in
  patients with decreased kidney function."
