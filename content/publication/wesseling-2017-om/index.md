abstract: 'BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Previously, we showed that patients undergoing carotid
  endarterectomy have an increased risk for major atherosclerotic events in the presence
  of moderate or poor kidney function. Acceleration of vascular inflammatory responses
  is considered to be causally involved in progression of atherogenesis and poor outcome
  in chronic kidney disease patients. The association between kidney function and
  plaque composition has not been thoroughly investigated yet. The aim of this study
  was to investigate the association between kidney function and atherosclerotic plaque
  composition in patients undergoing carotid endarterectomy. METHODS: Atherosclerotic
  plaques, harvested from 1796 patients who underwent carotid endarterectomy, were
  immunohistochemically stained for macrophages, smooth muscle cells, calcifications,
  collagen, microvessels, lipid core size and intraplaque hemorrhage. Cytokines were
  measured in plaque and plasma and associated with kidney function. Quantitative
  proteomics were performed on 40 carotid plaques and associated with kidney function.
  RESULTS: Decreased kidney function was associated with increased odds ratio of intraplaque
  hemorrhage, OR 1.15 (95% CI; 1.02-1.29 (p = 0.024)) and increased odds ratio of
  fibrous-atheromatous plaques (plaques with lipid core presenting more than 10% of
  total plaque surface) OR 1.21 (95% CI; 1.07-1.38 (p = 0.003)) per decrease of 20
  points in eGFR. Proteomics revealed that decreased kidney function was associated
  with upregulation of the classical pathway of the complement system and the intrinsic
  pathway of the coagulation system. CONCLUSIONS: Decreased kidney function was associated
  with plaque hemorrhage but not with inflammatory plaque characteristics. Our data
  suggests that other pathways than the inflammation-pathway are involved in plaque
  vulnerability and poor outcome in patients with decreased kidney function.'
