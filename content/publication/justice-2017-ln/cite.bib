 abstract = {Few genome-wide association studies (GWAS) account for
environmental exposures, like smoking, potentially impacting the
overall trait variance when investigating the genetic
contribution to obesity-related traits. Here, we use GWAS data
from 51,080 current smokers and 190,178 nonsmokers (87% European
descent) to identify loci influencing BMI and central adiposity,
measured as waist circumference and waist-to-hip ratio both
adjusted for BMI. We identify 23 novel genetic loci, and 9 loci
with convincing evidence of gene-smoking interaction (GxSMK) on
obesity-related traits. We show consistent direction of effect
for all identified loci and significance for 18 novel and for 5
interaction loci in an independent study sample. These loci
highlight novel biological functions, including response to
oxidative stress, addictive behaviour, and regulatory functions
emphasizing the importance of accounting for environment in
genetic analyses. Our results suggest that tobacco smoking may
alter the genetic susceptibility to overall adiposity and body
fat distribution.},
