 abstract = {BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Women who develop preeclampsia during
pregnancy are at a higher risk for developing cardiovascular
disease. As platelets are affected by preeclampsia, we set out
to identify whether platelets carry information in their
transcriptome on cardiovascular risk in women with former
preeclampsia. METHODS: Platelets were isolated from asymptomatic
women with previous preeclampsia, who underwent screening with
coronary computed tomography angiography. Platelet RNA was
isolated and used to construct gene networks using an unbiased
approach. Platelet gene modules assembled from the network were
related to risk factors and clinical traits of these women,
including coronary artery calcium scores (CACS). RESULTS: We
found multiple gene modules which correlated with CACS
(correlation coefficients: 0.44 to 0.59, p = 0.05 to 0.007). The
genes from two clinically relevant modules were expressed at a
higher level in the group with calcifications (p = 3.9 $\times$
10-10 and 0.02) and enriched for platelet-related gene-sets such
as platelet activation. The first of these modules was also
enriched (ppermutation = 0.0546) for genes mapped to known
coronary artery disease susceptibility loci. Additional unbiased
network analyses in platelet RNA of patients with overt
cardiovascular disease underlined the importance of the
identified modules for disease by high preservation. (p = 1.6
$\times$ 10-9 to 1.7 $\times$ 10-47). CONCLUSIONS: We found
platelet RNA modules that correlated with CACS in asymptomatic
women with previous preeclampsia. Whether or not platelets
directly contribute to this disease trajectory, or reflect the
underlying plaque substrate remains to be determined, but
enrichment for coronary artery disease susceptibility genes
emphasizes the importance for the disease.},
