abstract: 'BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Women who develop preeclampsia during pregnancy are
  at a higher risk for developing cardiovascular disease. As platelets are affected
  by preeclampsia, we set out to identify whether platelets carry information in their
  transcriptome on cardiovascular risk in women with former preeclampsia. METHODS:
  Platelets were isolated from asymptomatic women with previous preeclampsia, who
  underwent screening with coronary computed tomography angiography. Platelet RNA
  was isolated and used to construct gene networks using an unbiased approach. Platelet
  gene modules assembled from the network were related to risk factors and clinical
  traits of these women, including coronary artery calcium scores (CACS). RESULTS:
  We found multiple gene modules which correlated with CACS (correlation coefficients:
  0.44 to 0.59, p = 0.05 to 0.007). The genes from two clinically relevant modules
  were expressed at a higher level in the group with calcifications (p = 3.9 $times$
  10-10 and 0.02) and enriched for platelet-related gene-sets such as platelet activation.
  The first of these modules was also enriched (ppermutation = 0.0546) for genes mapped
  to known coronary artery disease susceptibility loci. Additional unbiased network
  analyses in platelet RNA of patients with overt cardiovascular disease underlined
  the importance of the identified modules for disease by high preservation. (p =
  1.6 $times$ 10-9 to 1.7 $times$ 10-47). CONCLUSIONS: We found platelet RNA modules
  that correlated with CACS in asymptomatic women with previous preeclampsia. Whether
  or not platelets directly contribute to this disease trajectory, or reflect the
  underlying plaque substrate remains to be determined, but enrichment for coronary
  artery disease susceptibility genes emphasizes the importance for the disease.'
