abstract: "BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Women who develop preeclampsia during pregnancy
  are at a higher risk for developing cardiovascular disease. As platelets are
  affected by preeclampsia, we set out to identify whether platelets carry
  information in their transcriptome on cardiovascular risk in women with former
  preeclampsia. METHODS: Platelets were isolated from asymptomatic women with
  previous preeclampsia, who underwent screening with coronary computed
  tomography angiography. Platelet RNA was isolated and used to construct gene
  networks using an unbiased approach. Platelet gene modules assembled from the
  network were related to risk factors and clinical traits of these women,
  including coronary artery calcium scores (CACS). RESULTS: We found multiple
  gene modules which correlated with CACS (correlation coefficients: 0.44 to
  0.59, p = 0.05 to 0.007). The genes from two clinically relevant modules were
  expressed at a higher level in the group with calcifications (p = 3.9 $times$
  10-10 and 0.02) and enriched for platelet-related gene-sets such as platelet
  activation. The first of these modules was also enriched (ppermutation =
  0.0546) for genes mapped to known coronary artery disease susceptibility loci.
  Additional unbiased network analyses in platelet RNA of patients with overt
  cardiovascular disease underlined the importance of the identified modules for
  disease by high preservation. (p = 1.6 $times$ 10-9 to 1.7 $times$ 10-47).
  CONCLUSIONS: We found platelet RNA modules that correlated with CACS in
  asymptomatic women with previous preeclampsia. Whether or not platelets
  directly contribute to this disease trajectory, or reflect the underlying
  plaque substrate remains to be determined, but enrichment for coronary artery
  disease susceptibility genes emphasizes the importance for the disease."
