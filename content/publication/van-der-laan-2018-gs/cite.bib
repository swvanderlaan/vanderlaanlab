 abstract = {In the last decade, over 175 genetic loci have robustly been
associated to levels of major circulating blood lipids. Most loci
are specific to one or two lipids, whereas some (SUGP1, ZPR1,
TRIB1, HERPUD1, and FADS1) are associated to all. While exposing
the polygenic architecture of circulating lipids and the
underpinnings of dyslipidaemia, these genome-wide association
studies (GWAS) have provided further evidence of the critical
role that lipids play in coronary heart disease (CHD) risk, as
indicated by the 2.7-fold enrichment for macrophage gene
expression in atherosclerotic plaques and the association of 25
loci (such as PCSK9, APOB, ABCG5-G8, KCNK5, LPL, HMGCR, NPC1L1,
CETP, TRIB1, ABO, PMAIP1-MC4R, and LDLR) with CHD. These GWAS
also confirmed known and commonly used therapeutic targets,
including HMGCR (statins), PCSK9 (antibodies), and NPC1L1
(ezetimibe). As we head into the post-GWAS era, we offer
suggestions for how to move forward beyond genetic risk loci,
towards refining the biology behind the associations and
identifying causal genes and therapeutic targets. Deep
phenotyping through lipidomics and metabolomics will refine and
increase the resolution to find causal and druggable targets, and
studies aimed at demonstrating gene transcriptional and
regulatory effects of lipid associated loci will further aid in
identifying these targets. Thus, we argue the need for deeply
phenotyped, large genetic association studies to reduce costs and
failures and increase the efficiency of the drug discovery
pipeline. We conjecture that in the next decade a paradigm shift
will tip the balance towards a data-driven approach to
therapeutic target development and the application of precision
medicine where human genomics takes centre stage.},
