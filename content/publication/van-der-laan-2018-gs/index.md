abstract: In the last decade, over 175 genetic loci have robustly been associated
  to levels of major circulating blood lipids. Most loci are specific to one or two
  lipids, whereas some (SUGP1, ZPR1, TRIB1, HERPUD1, and FADS1) are associated to
  all. While exposing the polygenic architecture of circulating lipids and the underpinnings
  of dyslipidaemia, these genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have provided further
  evidence of the critical role that lipids play in coronary heart disease (CHD) risk,
  as indicated by the 2.7-fold enrichment for macrophage gene expression in atherosclerotic
  plaques and the association of 25 loci (such as PCSK9, APOB, ABCG5-G8, KCNK5, LPL,
  HMGCR, NPC1L1, CETP, TRIB1, ABO, PMAIP1-MC4R, and LDLR) with CHD. These GWAS also
  confirmed known and commonly used therapeutic targets, including HMGCR (statins),
  PCSK9 (antibodies), and NPC1L1 (ezetimibe). As we head into the post-GWAS era, we
  offer suggestions for how to move forward beyond genetic risk loci, towards refining
  the biology behind the associations and identifying causal genes and therapeutic
  targets. Deep phenotyping through lipidomics and metabolomics will refine and increase
  the resolution to find causal and druggable targets, and studies aimed at demonstrating
  gene transcriptional and regulatory effects of lipid associated loci will further
  aid in identifying these targets. Thus, we argue the need for deeply phenotyped,
  large genetic association studies to reduce costs and failures and increase the
  efficiency of the drug discovery pipeline. We conjecture that in the next decade
  a paradigm shift will tip the balance towards a data-driven approach to therapeutic
  target development and the application of precision medicine where human genomics
  takes centre stage.
