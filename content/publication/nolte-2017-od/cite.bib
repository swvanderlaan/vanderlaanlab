 abstract = {Reduced cardiac vagal control reflected in low heart rate
variability (HRV) is associated with greater risks for cardiac
morbidity and mortality. In two-stage meta-analyses of
genome-wide association studies for three HRV traits in up to
53,174 individuals of European ancestry, we detect 17 genome-wide
significant SNPs in eight loci. HRV SNPs tag non-synonymous SNPs
(in NDUFA11 and KIAA1755), expression quantitative trait loci
(eQTLs) (influencing GNG11, RGS6 and NEO1), or are located in
genes preferentially expressed in the sinoatrial node (GNG11,
RGS6 and HCN4). Genetic risk scores account for 0.9 to 2.6% of
the HRV variance. Significant genetic correlation is found for
HRV with heart rate (-0.74<rg<-0.55) and blood pressure
(-0.35<rg<-0.20). These findings provide clinically relevant
biological insight into heritable variation in vagal heart rhythm
regulation, with a key role for genetic variants (GNG11, RGS6)
that influence G-protein heterotrimer action in GIRK-channel
induced pacemaker membrane hyperpolarization.},
