abstract: 'OBJECTIVE: To explore genetic and lifestyle risk factors of MRI-defined
  brain infarcts (BI) in large population-based cohorts. METHODS: We performed meta-analyses
  of genome-wide association studies (GWAS) and examined associations of vascular
  risk factors and their genetic risk scores (GRS) with MRI-defined BI and a subset
  of BI, namely, small subcortical BI (SSBI), in 18 population-based cohorts (n =
  20,949) from 5 ethnicities (3,726 with BI, 2,021 with SSBI). Top loci were followed
  up in 7 population-based cohorts (n = 6,862; 1,483 with BI, 630 with SBBI), and
  we tested associations with related phenotypes including ischemic stroke and pathologically
  defined BI. RESULTS: The mean prevalence was 17.7% for BI and 10.5% for SSBI, steeply
  rising after age 65. Two loci showed genome-wide significant association with BI:
  FBN2, p = 1.77 $times$ 10-8; and LINC00539/ZDHHC20, p = 5.82 $times$ 10-9. Both
  have been associated with blood pressure (BP)-related phenotypes, but did not replicate
  in the smaller follow-up sample or show associations with related phenotypes. Age-
  and sex-adjusted associations with BI and SSBI were observed for BP traits (p value
  for BI, p [BI] = 9.38 $times$ 10-25; p [SSBI] = 5.23 $times$ 10-14 for hypertension),
  smoking (p [BI] = 4.4 $times$ 10-10; p [SSBI] = 1.2 $times$ 10-4), diabetes (p [BI]
  = 1.7 $times$ 10-8; p [SSBI] = 2.8 $times$ 10-3), previous cardiovascular disease
  (p [BI] = 1.0 $times$ 10-18; p [SSBI] = 2.3 $times$ 10-7), stroke (p [BI] = 3.9
  $times$ 10-69; p [SSBI] = 3.2 $times$ 10-24), and MRI-defined white matter hyperintensity
  burden (p [BI] = 1.43 $times$ 10-157; p [SSBI] = 3.16 $times$ 10-106), but not with
  body mass index or cholesterol. GRS of BP traits were associated with BI and SSBI
  (p $łeq$ 0.0022), without indication of directional pleiotropy. CONCLUSION: In this
  multiethnic GWAS meta-analysis, including over 20,000 population-based participants,
  we identified genetic risk loci for BI requiring validation once additional large
  datasets become available. High BP, including genetically determined, was the most
  significant modifiable, causal risk factor for BI.'
