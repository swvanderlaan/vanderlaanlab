 abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To explore genetic and lifestyle risk factors of
MRI-defined brain infarcts (BI) in large population-based
cohorts. METHODS: We performed meta-analyses of genome-wide
association studies (GWAS) and examined associations of vascular
risk factors and their genetic risk scores (GRS) with
MRI-defined BI and a subset of BI, namely, small subcortical BI
(SSBI), in 18 population-based cohorts (n = 20,949) from 5
ethnicities (3,726 with BI, 2,021 with SSBI). Top loci were
followed up in 7 population-based cohorts (n = 6,862; 1,483 with
BI, 630 with SBBI), and we tested associations with related
phenotypes including ischemic stroke and pathologically defined
BI. RESULTS: The mean prevalence was 17.7% for BI and 10.5%
for SSBI, steeply rising after age 65. Two loci showed
genome-wide significant association with BI: FBN2, p = 1.77
$\times$ 10-8; and LINC00539/ZDHHC20, p = 5.82 $\times$ 10-9.
Both have been associated with blood pressure (BP)-related
phenotypes, but did not replicate in the smaller follow-up
sample or show associations with related phenotypes. Age- and
sex-adjusted associations with BI and SSBI were observed for BP
traits (p value for BI, p [BI] = 9.38 $\times$ 10-25; p [SSBI] =
5.23 $\times$ 10-14 for hypertension), smoking (p [BI] = 4.4
$\times$ 10-10; p [SSBI] = 1.2 $\times$ 10-4), diabetes (p [BI]
= 1.7 $\times$ 10-8; p [SSBI] = 2.8 $\times$ 10-3), previous
cardiovascular disease (p [BI] = 1.0 $\times$ 10-18; p [SSBI] =
2.3 $\times$ 10-7), stroke (p [BI] = 3.9 $\times$ 10-69; p
[SSBI] = 3.2 $\times$ 10-24), and MRI-defined white matter
hyperintensity burden (p [BI] = 1.43 $\times$ 10-157; p [SSBI] =
3.16 $\times$ 10-106), but not with body mass index or
cholesterol. GRS of BP traits were associated with BI and SSBI
(p $łeq$ 0.0022), without indication of directional pleiotropy.
CONCLUSION: In this multiethnic GWAS meta-analysis, including
over 20,000 population-based participants, we identified genetic
risk loci for BI requiring validation once additional large
datasets become available. High BP, including genetically
determined, was the most significant modifiable, causal risk
factor for BI.},
