 abstract = {Increased blood lipid levels are heritable risk factors of
cardiovascular disease with varied prevalence worldwide owing to
different dietary patterns and medication use1. Despite advances
in prevention and treatment, in particular through reducing
low-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels2, heart disease
remains the leading cause of death worldwide3.
Genome-wideassociation studies (GWAS) of blood lipid levels have
led to important biological and clinical insights, as well as
new drug targets, for cardiovascular disease. However, most
previous GWAS4-23 have been conducted in European ancestry
populations and may have missed genetic variants that contribute
to lipid-level variation in other ancestry groups. These include
differences in allele frequencies, effect sizes and
linkage-disequilibrium patterns24. Here we conduct a
multi-ancestry, genome-wide genetic discovery meta-analysis of
lipid levels in approximately 1.65 million individuals,
including 350,000 of non-European ancestries. We quantify the
gain in studying non-European ancestries and provide evidence to
support the expansion of recruitment of additional ancestries,
even with relatively small sample sizes. We find that increasing
diversity rather than studying additional individuals of
European ancestry results in substantial improvements in
fine-mapping functional variants and portability of polygenic
prediction (evaluated in approximately 295,000 individuals from
7 ancestry groupings). Modest gains in the number of discovered
loci and ancestry-specific variants were also achieved. As GWAS
expand emphasis beyond the identification of genes and
fundamental biology towards the use of genetic variants for
preventive and precision medicine25, we anticipate that
increased diversity of participants will lead to more accurate
and equitable26 application of polygenic scores in clinical
practice.},
