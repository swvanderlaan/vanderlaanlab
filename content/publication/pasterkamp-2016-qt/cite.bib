 abstract = {OBJECTIVE: The genetically modified mouse is the most commonly
used animal model for studying the pathogenesis of
atherosclerotic disease. We aimed to assess if mice
atherosclerosis-related genes could be validated in human disease
through examination of results from genome-wide association
studies. APPROACH AND RESULTS: We performed a systematic review
to identify atherosclerosis-causing genes in mice and carried out
gene-based association tests of their human orthologs for an
association with human coronary artery disease and human large
artery ischemic stroke. Moreover, we investigated the association
of these genes with human atherosclerotic plaque characteristics.
In addition, we assessed the presence of tissue-specific
cis-acting expression quantitative trait loci for these genes in
humans. Finally, using pathway analyses we show that the putative
atherosclerosis-causing genes revealed few associations with
human coronary artery disease, large artery ischemic stroke, or
atherosclerotic plaque characteristics, despite the fact that the
majority of these genes have cis-acting expression quantitative
trait loci. CONCLUSIONS: A role for genes that has been observed
in mice for atherosclerotic lesion development could scarcely be
confirmed by studying associations of disease development with
common human genetic variants. The value of murine
atherosclerotic models for selection of therapeutic targets in
human disease remains unclear.},
