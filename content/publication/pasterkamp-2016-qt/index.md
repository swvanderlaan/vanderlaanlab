abstract: "OBJECTIVE: The genetically modified mouse is the most commonly used
  animal model for studying the pathogenesis of atherosclerotic disease. We
  aimed to assess if mice atherosclerosis-related genes could be validated in
  human disease through examination of results from genome-wide association
  studies. APPROACH AND RESULTS: We performed a systematic review to identify
  atherosclerosis-causing genes in mice and carried out gene-based association
  tests of their human orthologs for an association with human coronary artery
  disease and human large artery ischemic stroke. Moreover, we investigated the
  association of these genes with human atherosclerotic plaque characteristics.
  In addition, we assessed the presence of tissue-specific cis-acting expression
  quantitative trait loci for these genes in humans. Finally, using pathway
  analyses we show that the putative atherosclerosis-causing genes revealed few
  associations with human coronary artery disease, large artery ischemic stroke,
  or atherosclerotic plaque characteristics, despite the fact that the majority
  of these genes have cis-acting expression quantitative trait loci.
  CONCLUSIONS: A role for genes that has been observed in mice for
  atherosclerotic lesion development could scarcely be confirmed by studying
  associations of disease development with common human genetic variants. The
  value of murine atherosclerotic models for selection of therapeutic targets in
  human disease remains unclear."
