abstract: 'OBJECTIVE: The genetically modified mouse is the most commonly used animal
  model for studying the pathogenesis of atherosclerotic disease. We aimed to assess
  if mice atherosclerosis-related genes could be validated in human disease through
  examination of results from genome-wide association studies. APPROACH AND RESULTS:
  We performed a systematic review to identify atherosclerosis-causing genes in mice
  and carried out gene-based association tests of their human orthologs for an association
  with human coronary artery disease and human large artery ischemic stroke. Moreover,
  we investigated the association of these genes with human atherosclerotic plaque
  characteristics. In addition, we assessed the presence of tissue-specific cis-acting
  expression quantitative trait loci for these genes in humans. Finally, using pathway
  analyses we show that the putative atherosclerosis-causing genes revealed few associations
  with human coronary artery disease, large artery ischemic stroke, or atherosclerotic
  plaque characteristics, despite the fact that the majority of these genes have cis-acting
  expression quantitative trait loci. CONCLUSIONS: A role for genes that has been
  observed in mice for atherosclerotic lesion development could scarcely be confirmed
  by studying associations of disease development with common human genetic variants.
  The value of murine atherosclerotic models for selection of therapeutic targets
  in human disease remains unclear.'
