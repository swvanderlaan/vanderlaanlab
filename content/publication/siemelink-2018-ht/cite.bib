 abstract = {BACKGROUND: Tobacco smoking is a major risk factor for
atherosclerotic disease and has been associated with DNA
methylation (DNAm) changes in blood cells. However, whether
smoking influences DNAm in the diseased vascular wall is unknown
but may prove crucial in understanding the pathophysiology of
atherosclerosis. In this study, we associated current tobacco
smoking to epigenome-wide DNAm in atherosclerotic plaques from
patients undergoing carotid endarterectomy. METHODS: DNAm at
commonly methylated sites (cytosine-guanine nucleotide pairs
separated by a phospho-group [CpGs]) was assessed in
atherosclerotic plaque samples and peripheral blood samples from
485 carotid endarterectomy patients. We tested the association
of current tobacco smoking with DNAm corrected for age and sex.
To control for bias and inflation because of cellular
heterogeneity, we applied a Bayesian method to estimate an
empirical null distribution as implemented by the R package
bacon. Replication of the smoking-associated methylated CpGs in
atherosclerotic plaques was executed in the second sample of 190
carotid endarterectomy patients, and results were meta-analyzed
using a fixed-effects model. RESULTS: Tobacco smoking was
significantly associated to differential DNAm in atherosclerotic
lesions of 4 CpGs (false discovery rate <0.05) mapped to 2
different genes ( AHRR, ITPK1) and 17 CpGs mapped to 8 genes and
RNAs in blood. The strongest associations were found for CpGs
mapped to the gene AHRR, a repressor of the aryl hydrocarbon
receptor transcription factor involved in xenobiotic
detoxification. One of these methylated CpGs were found to be
regulated by local genetic variation. CONCLUSIONS: The risk
factor tobacco smoking associates with DNAm at multiple loci in
carotid atherosclerotic lesions. These observations support
further investigation of the relationship between risk factors
and epigenetic regulation in atherosclerotic disease.},
