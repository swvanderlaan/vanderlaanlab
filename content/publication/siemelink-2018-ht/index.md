abstract: "BACKGROUND: Tobacco smoking is a major risk factor for
  atherosclerotic disease and has been associated with DNA methylation (DNAm)
  changes in blood cells. However, whether smoking influences DNAm in the
  diseased vascular wall is unknown but may prove crucial in understanding the
  pathophysiology of atherosclerosis. In this study, we associated current
  tobacco smoking to epigenome-wide DNAm in atherosclerotic plaques from
  patients undergoing carotid endarterectomy. METHODS: DNAm at commonly
  methylated sites (cytosine-guanine nucleotide pairs separated by a
  phospho-group [CpGs]) was assessed in atherosclerotic plaque samples and
  peripheral blood samples from 485 carotid endarterectomy patients. We tested
  the association of current tobacco smoking with DNAm corrected for age and
  sex. To control for bias and inflation because of cellular heterogeneity, we
  applied a Bayesian method to estimate an empirical null distribution as
  implemented by the R package bacon. Replication of the smoking-associated
  methylated CpGs in atherosclerotic plaques was executed in the second sample
  of 190 carotid endarterectomy patients, and results were meta-analyzed using a
  fixed-effects model. RESULTS: Tobacco smoking was significantly associated to
  differential DNAm in atherosclerotic lesions of 4 CpGs (false discovery rate
  <0.05) mapped to 2 different genes ( AHRR, ITPK1) and 17 CpGs mapped to 8
  genes and RNAs in blood. The strongest associations were found for CpGs mapped
  to the gene AHRR, a repressor of the aryl hydrocarbon receptor transcription
  factor involved in xenobiotic detoxification. One of these methylated CpGs
  were found to be regulated by local genetic variation. CONCLUSIONS: The risk
  factor tobacco smoking associates with DNAm at multiple loci in carotid
  atherosclerotic lesions. These observations support further investigation of
  the relationship between risk factors and epigenetic regulation in
  atherosclerotic disease."
