abstract: 'BACKGROUND: Tobacco smoking is a major risk factor for atherosclerotic
  disease and has been associated with DNA methylation (DNAm) changes in blood cells.
  However, whether smoking influences DNAm in the diseased vascular wall is unknown
  but may prove crucial in understanding the pathophysiology of atherosclerosis. In
  this study, we associated current tobacco smoking to epigenome-wide DNAm in atherosclerotic
  plaques from patients undergoing carotid endarterectomy. METHODS: DNAm at commonly
  methylated sites (cytosine-guanine nucleotide pairs separated by a phospho-group
  [CpGs]) was assessed in atherosclerotic plaque samples and peripheral blood samples
  from 485 carotid endarterectomy patients. We tested the association of current tobacco
  smoking with DNAm corrected for age and sex. To control for bias and inflation because
  of cellular heterogeneity, we applied a Bayesian method to estimate an empirical
  null distribution as implemented by the R package bacon. Replication of the smoking-associated
  methylated CpGs in atherosclerotic plaques was executed in the second sample of
  190 carotid endarterectomy patients, and results were meta-analyzed using a fixed-effects
  model. RESULTS: Tobacco smoking was significantly associated to differential DNAm
  in atherosclerotic lesions of 4 CpGs (false discovery rate <0.05) mapped to 2 different
  genes ( AHRR, ITPK1) and 17 CpGs mapped to 8 genes and RNAs in blood. The strongest
  associations were found for CpGs mapped to the gene AHRR, a repressor of the aryl
  hydrocarbon receptor transcription factor involved in xenobiotic detoxification.
  One of these methylated CpGs were found to be regulated by local genetic variation.
  CONCLUSIONS: The risk factor tobacco smoking associates with DNAm at multiple loci
  in carotid atherosclerotic lesions. These observations support further investigation
  of the relationship between risk factors and epigenetic regulation in atherosclerotic
  disease.'
