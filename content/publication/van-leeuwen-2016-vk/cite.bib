 abstract = {BACKGROUND: So far, more than 170 loci have been associated with
circulating lipid levels through genome-wide association studies
(GWAS). These associations are largely driven by common variants,
their function is often not known, and many are likely to be
markers for the causal variants. In this study we aimed to
identify more new rare and low-frequency functional variants
associated with circulating lipid levels. METHODS: We used the
1000 Genomes Project as a reference panel for the imputations of
GWAS data from ∼60 000 individuals in the discovery stage and ∼90
000 samples in the replication stage. RESULTS: Our study resulted
in the identification of five new associations with circulating
lipid levels at four loci. All four loci are within genes that
can be linked biologically to lipid metabolism. One of the
variants, rs116843064, is a damaging missense variant within the
ANGPTL4 gene. CONCLUSIONS: This study illustrates that GWAS with
high-scale imputation may still help us unravel the biological
mechanism behind circulating lipid levels.},
