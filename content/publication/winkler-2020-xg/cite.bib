 abstract = {A missense variant of the sushi, von Willebrand factor type A,
EGF and pentraxin domain containing protein 1 (SVEP1) is
genome-wide significantly associated with coronary artery
disease. The mechanisms how SVEP1 impacts atherosclerosis are
not known. We found endothelial cells (EC) and vascular smooth
muscle cells to represent the major cellular source of SVEP1 in
plaques. Plaques were larger in atherosclerosis-prone Svep1
haploinsufficient (ApoE-/-Svep1+/-) compared to Svep1 wild-type
mice (ApoE-/-Svep1+/+) and ApoE-/-Svep1+/- mice displayed
elevated plaque neutrophil, Ly6Chigh monocyte, and macrophage
numbers. We assessed how leukocytes accumulated more inside
plaques in ApoE-/-Svep1+/- mice and found enhanced leukocyte
recruitment from blood into plaques. In vitro, we examined how
SVEP1 deficiency promotes leukocyte recruitment and found
elevated expression of the leukocyte attractant chemokine (C-X-C
motif) ligand 1 (CXCL1) in EC after incubation with missense
compared to wild-type SVEP1. Increasing wild-type SVEP1 levels
silenced endothelial CXCL1 release. In line, plasma Cxcl1 levels
were elevated in ApoE-/-Svep1+/- mice. Our studies reveal an
atheroprotective role of SVEP1. Deficiency of wild-type Svep1
increased endothelial CXCL1 expression leading to enhanced
recruitment of proinflammatory leukocytes from blood to plaque.
Consequently, elevated vascular inflammation resulted in
enhanced plaque progression in Svep1 deficiency.},
