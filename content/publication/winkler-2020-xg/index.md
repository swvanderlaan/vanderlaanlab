abstract: A missense variant of the sushi, von Willebrand factor type A, EGF and pentraxin
  domain containing protein 1 (SVEP1) is genome-wide significantly associated with
  coronary artery disease. The mechanisms how SVEP1 impacts atherosclerosis are not
  known. We found endothelial cells (EC) and vascular smooth muscle cells to represent
  the major cellular source of SVEP1 in plaques. Plaques were larger in atherosclerosis-prone
  Svep1 haploinsufficient (ApoE-/-Svep1+/-) compared to Svep1 wild-type mice (ApoE-/-Svep1+/+)
  and ApoE-/-Svep1+/- mice displayed elevated plaque neutrophil, Ly6Chigh monocyte,
  and macrophage numbers. We assessed how leukocytes accumulated more inside plaques
  in ApoE-/-Svep1+/- mice and found enhanced leukocyte recruitment from blood into
  plaques. In vitro, we examined how SVEP1 deficiency promotes leukocyte recruitment
  and found elevated expression of the leukocyte attractant chemokine (C-X-C motif)
  ligand 1 (CXCL1) in EC after incubation with missense compared to wild-type SVEP1.
  Increasing wild-type SVEP1 levels silenced endothelial CXCL1 release. In line, plasma
  Cxcl1 levels were elevated in ApoE-/-Svep1+/- mice. Our studies reveal an atheroprotective
  role of SVEP1. Deficiency of wild-type Svep1 increased endothelial CXCL1 expression
  leading to enhanced recruitment of proinflammatory leukocytes from blood to plaque.
  Consequently, elevated vascular inflammation resulted in enhanced plaque progression
  in Svep1 deficiency.
