abstract: 'Recent genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have discovered ten genetic
  risk variants for abdominal aortic aneurysms (AAA). To what extent these genetic
  variants contribute to the pathology of aneurysms is yet unknown. The present study
  aims to investigate whether genetic risk variants are associated with three clinical
  features: diameter of aneurysm sac, type of artery and aneurysm related-symptoms
  in aortic and peripheral aneurysm patients. Aneurysm tissue of 415 patients included
  in the Aneurysm-Express biobank was used. A best-fit polygenic risk score (PRS)
  based on previous GWAS effect estimates was modeled for each clinical phenotype.
  The best-fit PRS (including 272 variants at PT = 0.01015) showed a significant correlation
  with aneurysm diameter (R2 = 0.019, p = 0.001). No polygenic association was found
  with clinical symptoms or artery type. In addition, the ten genome-wide significant
  risk variants for AAA were tested individually, but no associations were observed
  with any of the clinical phenotypes. All models were corrected for confounders and
  data was normalized. In conclusion, a weighted PRS of AAA susceptibility explained
  1.9% of the phenotypic variation (p = 0.001) in diameter in aneurysm patients. Given
  our limited sample size, future biobank collaborations need to confirm a potential
  causal role of susceptibility variants on aneurysmal disease initiation and progression.'
