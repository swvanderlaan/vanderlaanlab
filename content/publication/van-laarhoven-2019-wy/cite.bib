 abstract = {Recent genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have discovered
ten genetic risk variants for abdominal aortic aneurysms (AAA).
To what extent these genetic variants contribute to the
pathology of aneurysms is yet unknown. The present study aims to
investigate whether genetic risk variants are associated with
three clinical features: diameter of aneurysm sac, type of
artery and aneurysm related-symptoms in aortic and peripheral
aneurysm patients. Aneurysm tissue of 415 patients included in
the Aneurysm-Express biobank was used. A best-fit polygenic risk
score (PRS) based on previous GWAS effect estimates was modeled
for each clinical phenotype. The best-fit PRS (including 272
variants at PT = 0.01015) showed a significant correlation with
aneurysm diameter (R2 = 0.019, p = 0.001). No polygenic
association was found with clinical symptoms or artery type. In
addition, the ten genome-wide significant risk variants for AAA
were tested individually, but no associations were observed with
any of the clinical phenotypes. All models were corrected for
confounders and data was normalized. In conclusion, a weighted
PRS of AAA susceptibility explained 1.9% of the phenotypic
variation (p = 0.001) in diameter in aneurysm patients. Given
our limited sample size, future biobank collaborations need to
confirm a potential causal role of susceptibility variants on
aneurysmal disease initiation and progression.},
