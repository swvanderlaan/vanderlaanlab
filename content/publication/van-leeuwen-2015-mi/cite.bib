 abstract = {BACKGROUND: Individuals with exceptional longevity and their
offspring have significantly larger high-density lipoprotein
concentrations (HDL-C) particle sizes due to the increased
homozygosity for the I405V variant in the cholesteryl ester
transfer protein (CETP) gene. In this study, we investigate the
association of CETP and HDL-C further to identify novel,
independent CETP variants associated with HDL-C in humans.
METHODS: We performed a meta-analysis of HDL-C within the CETP
region using 59,432 individuals imputed with 1000 Genomes data.
We performed replication in an independent sample of 47,866
individuals and validation was done by Sanger sequencing.
RESULTS: The meta-analysis of HDL-C within the CETP region
identified five independent variants, including an exonic variant
and a common intronic insertion. We replicated these 5 variants
significantly in an independent sample of 47,866 individuals.
Sanger sequencing of the insertion within a single family
confirmed segregation of this variant. The strongest reported
association between HDL-C and CETP variants, was rs3764261;
however, after conditioning on the five novel variants we
identified the support for rs3764261 was highly reduced
($β$unadjusted=3.179 mg/dl (P value=5.25$\times$10-509),
$β$adjusted=0.859 mg/dl (P value=9.51$\times$10-25)), and
this finding suggests that these five novel variants may partly
explain the association of CETP with HDL-C. Indeed, three of the
five novel variants (rs34065661, rs5817082, rs7499892) are
independent of rs3764261. CONCLUSIONS: The causal variants in
CETP that account for the association with HDL-C remain unknown.
We used studies imputed to the 1000 Genomes reference panel for
fine mapping of the CETP region. We identified and validated five
variants within this region that may partly account for the
association of the known variant (rs3764261), as well as other
sources of genetic contribution to HDL-C.},
