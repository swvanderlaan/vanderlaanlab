abstract: 'BACKGROUND: Individuals with exceptional longevity and their offspring
  have significantly larger high-density lipoprotein concentrations (HDL-C) particle
  sizes due to the increased homozygosity for the I405V variant in the cholesteryl
  ester transfer protein (CETP) gene. In this study, we investigate the association
  of CETP and HDL-C further to identify novel, independent CETP variants associated
  with HDL-C in humans. METHODS: We performed a meta-analysis of HDL-C within the
  CETP region using 59,432 individuals imputed with 1000 Genomes data. We performed
  replication in an independent sample of 47,866 individuals and validation was done
  by Sanger sequencing. RESULTS: The meta-analysis of HDL-C within the CETP region
  identified five independent variants, including an exonic variant and a common intronic
  insertion. We replicated these 5 variants significantly in an independent sample
  of 47,866 individuals. Sanger sequencing of the insertion within a single family
  confirmed segregation of this variant. The strongest reported association between
  HDL-C and CETP variants, was rs3764261; however, after conditioning on the five
  novel variants we identified the support for rs3764261 was highly reduced ($β$unadjusted=3.179
  mg/dl (P value=5.25$times$10-509), $β$adjusted=0.859 mg/dl (P value=9.51$times$10-25)),
  and this finding suggests that these five novel variants may partly explain the
  association of CETP with HDL-C. Indeed, three of the five novel variants (rs34065661,
  rs5817082, rs7499892) are independent of rs3764261. CONCLUSIONS: The causal variants
  in CETP that account for the association with HDL-C remain unknown. We used studies
  imputed to the 1000 Genomes reference panel for fine mapping of the CETP region.
  We identified and validated five variants within this region that may partly account
  for the association of the known variant (rs3764261), as well as other sources of
  genetic contribution to HDL-C.'
