 abstract = {BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Atherosclerosis is a lipid-driven
inflammatory disease presumably initiated by endothelial
activation. Low vascular shear stress is known for its ability
to activate endothelial cells. Differential DNA methylation
(DNAm) is a relatively unexplored player in atherosclerotic
disease development and endothelial dysfunction. Previous
studies showed that the expression of 11 genes was associated
with differential DNAm due to low shear stress in murine
endothelial cells. We hypothesized a causal relationship between
DNAm of shear stress associated genes in human carotid plaque
and increased risk of cardiovascular disease. METHODS: Using
Mendelian randomisation (MR) analysis, we explored the potential
causal role of DNAm of shear stress associated genes on
cardiovascular disease risk. We used data from the
Athero-Expression Biobank Study for the discovery of methylation
quantitative trait loci (mQTLs) in 442 advanced carotid plaques.
Next, we performed MR analysis using these mQTLs and publicly
available GWAS summary statistics of coronary artery disease
(CAD) and ischemic stroke (IS). RESULTS: We discovered 9 mQTLs
in plaque in the promoters of shear stress associated genes. We
found no significant effect of shear stress gene promoter
methylation and increased risk of CAD and IS. CONCLUSIONS:
Differential methylation of shear stress associated genes in
advanced atherosclerotic plaques in unlikely to increase
cardiovascular risk in human.},
