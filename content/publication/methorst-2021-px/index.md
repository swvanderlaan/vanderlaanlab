abstract: "BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Atherosclerosis is a lipid-driven inflammatory
  disease presumably initiated by endothelial activation. Low vascular shear
  stress is known for its ability to activate endothelial cells. Differential
  DNA methylation (DNAm) is a relatively unexplored player in atherosclerotic
  disease development and endothelial dysfunction. Previous studies showed that
  the expression of 11 genes was associated with differential DNAm due to low
  shear stress in murine endothelial cells. We hypothesized a causal
  relationship between DNAm of shear stress associated genes in human carotid
  plaque and increased risk of cardiovascular disease. METHODS: Using Mendelian
  randomisation (MR) analysis, we explored the potential causal role of DNAm of
  shear stress associated genes on cardiovascular disease risk. We used data
  from the Athero-Expression Biobank Study for the discovery of methylation
  quantitative trait loci (mQTLs) in 442 advanced carotid plaques. Next, we
  performed MR analysis using these mQTLs and publicly available GWAS summary
  statistics of coronary artery disease (CAD) and ischemic stroke (IS). RESULTS:
  We discovered 9 mQTLs in plaque in the promoters of shear stress associated
  genes. We found no significant effect of shear stress gene promoter
  methylation and increased risk of CAD and IS. CONCLUSIONS: Differential
  methylation of shear stress associated genes in advanced atherosclerotic
  plaques in unlikely to increase cardiovascular risk in human."
