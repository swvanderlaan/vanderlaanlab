abstract: 'BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Atherosclerosis is a lipid-driven inflammatory disease
  presumably initiated by endothelial activation. Low vascular shear stress is known
  for its ability to activate endothelial cells. Differential DNA methylation (DNAm)
  is a relatively unexplored player in atherosclerotic disease development and endothelial
  dysfunction. Previous studies showed that the expression of 11 genes was associated
  with differential DNAm due to low shear stress in murine endothelial cells. We hypothesized
  a causal relationship between DNAm of shear stress associated genes in human carotid
  plaque and increased risk of cardiovascular disease. METHODS: Using Mendelian randomisation
  (MR) analysis, we explored the potential causal role of DNAm of shear stress associated
  genes on cardiovascular disease risk. We used data from the Athero-Expression Biobank
  Study for the discovery of methylation quantitative trait loci (mQTLs) in 442 advanced
  carotid plaques. Next, we performed MR analysis using these mQTLs and publicly available
  GWAS summary statistics of coronary artery disease (CAD) and ischemic stroke (IS).
  RESULTS: We discovered 9 mQTLs in plaque in the promoters of shear stress associated
  genes. We found no significant effect of shear stress gene promoter methylation
  and increased risk of CAD and IS. CONCLUSIONS: Differential methylation of shear
  stress associated genes in advanced atherosclerotic plaques in unlikely to increase
  cardiovascular risk in human.'
