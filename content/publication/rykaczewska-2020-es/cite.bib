 abstract = {RATIONALE: PCSKs (Proprotein convertase subtilisins/kexins) are
a protease family with unknown functions in vasculature.
Previously, we demonstrated PCSK6 upregulation in human
atherosclerotic plaques associated with smooth muscle cells
(SMCs), inflammation, extracellular matrix remodeling, and
mitogens. OBJECTIVE: Here, we applied a systems biology approach
to gain deeper insights into the PCSK6 role in normal and
diseased vessel wall. METHODS AND RESULTS: Genetic analyses
revealed association of intronic PCSK6 variant rs1531817 with
maximum internal carotid intima-media thickness progression in
high-cardiovascular risk subjects. This variant was linked with
PCSK6 mRNA expression in healthy aortas and plaques but also
with overall plaque SMA+ cell content and pericyte fraction.
Increased PCSK6 expression was found in several independent
human cohorts comparing atherosclerotic lesions versus healthy
arteries, using transcriptomic and proteomic datasets. By
immunohistochemistry, PCSK6 was localized to fibrous cap SMA+
cells and neovessels in plaques. In human, rat, and mouse
intimal hyperplasia, PCSK6 was expressed by proliferating SMA+
cells and upregulated after 5 days in rat carotid balloon injury
model, with positive correlation to PDGFB (platelet-derived
growth factor subunit B) and MMP (matrix metalloprotease)
2/MMP14. Here, PCSK6 was shown to colocalize and cointeract with
MMP2/MMP14 by in situ proximity ligation assay. Microarrays of
carotid arteries from Pcsk6-/- versus control mice revealed
suppression of contractile SMC markers, extracellular matrix
remodeling enzymes, and cytokines/receptors. Pcsk6-/- mice
showed reduced intimal hyperplasia response upon carotid
ligation in vivo, accompanied by decreased MMP14 activation and
impaired SMC outgrowth from aortic rings ex vivo. PCSK6
silencing in human SMCs in vitro leads to downregulation of
contractile markers and increase in MMP2 expression. Conversely,
PCSK6 overexpression increased PDGFBB (platelet-derived growth
factor BB)-induced cell proliferation and particularly
migration. CONCLUSIONS: PCSK6 is a novel protease that induces
SMC migration in response to PDGFB, mechanistically via
modulation of contractile markers and MMP14 activation. This
study establishes PCSK6 as a key regulator of SMC function in
vascular remodeling. Visual Overview: An online visual overview
