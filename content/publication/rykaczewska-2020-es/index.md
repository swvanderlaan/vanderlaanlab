abstract: "RATIONALE: PCSKs (Proprotein convertase subtilisins/kexins) are a
  protease family with unknown functions in vasculature. Previously, we
  demonstrated PCSK6 upregulation in human atherosclerotic plaques associated
  with smooth muscle cells (SMCs), inflammation, extracellular matrix
  remodeling, and mitogens. OBJECTIVE: Here, we applied a systems biology
  approach to gain deeper insights into the PCSK6 role in normal and diseased
  vessel wall. METHODS AND RESULTS: Genetic analyses revealed association of
  intronic PCSK6 variant rs1531817 with maximum internal carotid intima-media
  thickness progression in high-cardiovascular risk subjects. This variant was
  linked with PCSK6 mRNA expression in healthy aortas and plaques but also with
  overall plaque SMA+ cell content and pericyte fraction. Increased PCSK6
  expression was found in several independent human cohorts comparing
  atherosclerotic lesions versus healthy arteries, using transcriptomic and
  proteomic datasets. By immunohistochemistry, PCSK6 was localized to fibrous
  cap SMA+ cells and neovessels in plaques. In human, rat, and mouse intimal
  hyperplasia, PCSK6 was expressed by proliferating SMA+ cells and upregulated
  after 5 days in rat carotid balloon injury model, with positive correlation to
  PDGFB (platelet-derived growth factor subunit B) and MMP (matrix
  metalloprotease) 2/MMP14. Here, PCSK6 was shown to colocalize and cointeract
  with MMP2/MMP14 by in situ proximity ligation assay. Microarrays of carotid
  arteries from Pcsk6-/- versus control mice revealed suppression of contractile
  SMC markers, extracellular matrix remodeling enzymes, and cytokines/receptors.
  Pcsk6-/- mice showed reduced intimal hyperplasia response upon carotid
  ligation in vivo, accompanied by decreased MMP14 activation and impaired SMC
  outgrowth from aortic rings ex vivo. PCSK6 silencing in human SMCs in vitro
  leads to downregulation of contractile markers and increase in MMP2
  expression. Conversely, PCSK6 overexpression increased PDGFBB
  (platelet-derived growth factor BB)-induced cell proliferation and
  particularly migration. CONCLUSIONS: PCSK6 is a novel protease that induces
  SMC migration in response to PDGFB, mechanistically via modulation of
  contractile markers and MMP14 activation. This study establishes PCSK6 as a
  key regulator of SMC function in vascular remodeling. Visual Overview: An
  online visual overview is available for this article."
