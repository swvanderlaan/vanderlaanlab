 abstract = {BACKGROUND: Time-dependent trends in the incidence of
cardiovascular disease have been reported in high-income
countries. Because atherosclerosis underlies the majority of
cardiovascular diseases, we investigated temporal changes in the
composition of atherosclerotic plaques removed from patients
undergoing carotid endarterectomy. METHODS AND RESULTS: The
Athero-Express study is an ongoing, longitudinal, vascular
biobank study that includes the collection of atherosclerotic
plaques of patients undergoing primary carotid endarterectomy in
the province of Utrecht from 2002 to 2011. Histopathologic
features of plaques of 1583 patients were analyzed in intervals
of 2 years. The analysis included quantification of collagen,
calcifications, lipid cores, plaque thrombosis, macrophages,
smooth muscle cells, and microvessels. Large atheroma, plaque
thrombosis, macrophages, and calcifications were less frequently
observed over time, with adjusted odds ratios of 0.72 (95%
confidence interval, 0.650-0.789), 0.62 (95% confidence
interval, 0.569-0.679), 0.87 (95% confidence interval,
0.800-0.940), and 0.75 (95% confidence interval, 0.692-0.816)
per 2-year increase in time, respectively. These changes in
plaque characteristics were consistently observed in patient
subgroups presenting with stroke, transient ischemic attack,
ocular symptoms, and asymptomatic patients. Concomitantly, risk
factor management and secondary prevention strategies among
vascular patients scheduled for carotid endarterectomy
significantly improved over the past decade. CONCLUSIONS: In
conclusion, over the past decade, atherosclerotic plaques
harvested during carotid endarterectomy show a time-dependent
change in plaque composition characterized by a decrease in
features currently believed to be causal for plaque instability.
This appears to go hand in hand with improvements in risk factor
management.},
