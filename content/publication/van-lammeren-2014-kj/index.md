abstract: 'BACKGROUND: Time-dependent trends in the incidence of cardiovascular disease
  have been reported in high-income countries. Because atherosclerosis underlies the
  majority of cardiovascular diseases, we investigated temporal changes in the composition
  of atherosclerotic plaques removed from patients undergoing carotid endarterectomy.
  METHODS AND RESULTS: The Athero-Express study is an ongoing, longitudinal, vascular
  biobank study that includes the collection of atherosclerotic plaques of patients
  undergoing primary carotid endarterectomy in the province of Utrecht from 2002 to
  2011. Histopathologic features of plaques of 1583 patients were analyzed in intervals
  of 2 years. The analysis included quantification of collagen, calcifications, lipid
  cores, plaque thrombosis, macrophages, smooth muscle cells, and microvessels. Large
  atheroma, plaque thrombosis, macrophages, and calcifications were less frequently
  observed over time, with adjusted odds ratios of 0.72 (95% confidence interval,
  0.650-0.789), 0.62 (95% confidence interval, 0.569-0.679), 0.87 (95% confidence
  interval, 0.800-0.940), and 0.75 (95% confidence interval, 0.692-0.816) per 2-year
  increase in time, respectively. These changes in plaque characteristics were consistently
  observed in patient subgroups presenting with stroke, transient ischemic attack,
  ocular symptoms, and asymptomatic patients. Concomitantly, risk factor management
  and secondary prevention strategies among vascular patients scheduled for carotid
  endarterectomy significantly improved over the past decade. CONCLUSIONS: In conclusion,
  over the past decade, atherosclerotic plaques harvested during carotid endarterectomy
  show a time-dependent change in plaque composition characterized by a decrease in
  features currently believed to be causal for plaque instability. This appears to
  go hand in hand with improvements in risk factor management.'
