 abstract = {Height is a highly heritable, classic polygenic trait with
approximately 700 common associated variants identified through
genome-wide association studies so far. Here, we report 83
height-associated coding variants with lower minor-allele
frequencies (in the range of 0.1-4.8%) and effects of up to 2
centimetres per allele (such as those in IHH, STC2, AR and
CRISPLD2), greater than ten times the average effect of common
variants. In functional follow-up studies, rare height-increasing
alleles of STC2 (giving an increase of 1-2 centimetres per
allele) compromised proteolytic inhibition of PAPP-A and
increased cleavage of IGFBP-4 in vitro, resulting in higher
bioavailability of insulin-like growth factors. These 83
height-associated variants overlap genes that are mutated in
monogenic growth disorders and highlight new biological
candidates (such as ADAMTS3, IL11RA and NOX4) and pathways (such
as proteoglycan and glycosaminoglycan synthesis) involved in
growth. Our results demonstrate that sufficiently large sample
sizes can uncover rare and low-frequency variants of
moderate-to-large effect associated with polygenic human
phenotypes, and that these variants implicate relevant genes and
pathways.},
