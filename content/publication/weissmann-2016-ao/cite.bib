 abstract = {Brain region-specific abnormalities in serotonergic transmission
appear to underlie suicidal behavior. Alterations of RNA editing
on the serotonin receptor 2C (HTR2C) pre-mRNA in the brain of
suicides produce transcripts that attenuate 5-HT2CR signaling by
impairing intracellular G-protein coupling and subsequent
intracellular signal transduction. In brain, the distribution of
RNA-editing enzymes catalyzing deamination (A-to-I modification)
shows regional variation, including within the cerebral cortex.
We tested the hypothesis that altered pre-mRNA 5-HT2CR receptor
editing in suicide is region-specific. To this end, we
investigated the complete 5-HT2CR mRNA-editing profile in two
architectonically distinct cortical areas involved in mood
regulation and decision-making in a clinically well-characterized
cohort of age- and sex-matched non-psychiatric drug-free controls
and depressed suicides. By using an original biochemical
detection method, that is, capillary electrophoresis
single-stranded conformational polymorphism (CE-SSCP), we
corroborated the 5-HT2CR mRNA-editing profile previously
described in the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (Brodmann area 9
(BA9)). Editing of 5-HT2CR mRNA displayed clear regional
difference when comparing dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (BA9)
and anterior cingulate cortex (BA24). Compared with
non-psychiatric control individuals, alterations of editing
levels of 5-HT2CR mRNA were detected in both cortical areas of
depressed suicides. A marked increase in editing on 5-HT2CR was
especially observed in the anterior cingulate cortex in suicides,
implicating this cortical area in suicide risk. The results
suggest that region-specific changes in RNA editing of 5-HT2CR
mRNA and deficient receptor function likely contribute to the
etiology of major depressive disorder or suicide.},
