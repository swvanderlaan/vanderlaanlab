abstract: Brain region-specific abnormalities in serotonergic transmission appear
  to underlie suicidal behavior. Alterations of RNA editing on the serotonin receptor
  2C (HTR2C) pre-mRNA in the brain of suicides produce transcripts that attenuate
  5-HT2CR signaling by impairing intracellular G-protein coupling and subsequent intracellular
  signal transduction. In brain, the distribution of RNA-editing enzymes catalyzing
  deamination (A-to-I modification) shows regional variation, including within the
  cerebral cortex. We tested the hypothesis that altered pre-mRNA 5-HT2CR receptor
  editing in suicide is region-specific. To this end, we investigated the complete
  5-HT2CR mRNA-editing profile in two architectonically distinct cortical areas involved
  in mood regulation and decision-making in a clinically well-characterized cohort
  of age- and sex-matched non-psychiatric drug-free controls and depressed suicides.
  By using an original biochemical detection method, that is, capillary electrophoresis
  single-stranded conformational polymorphism (CE-SSCP), we corroborated the 5-HT2CR
  mRNA-editing profile previously described in the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex
  (Brodmann area 9 (BA9)). Editing of 5-HT2CR mRNA displayed clear regional difference
  when comparing dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (BA9) and anterior cingulate cortex
  (BA24). Compared with non-psychiatric control individuals, alterations of editing
  levels of 5-HT2CR mRNA were detected in both cortical areas of depressed suicides.
  A marked increase in editing on 5-HT2CR was especially observed in the anterior
  cingulate cortex in suicides, implicating this cortical area in suicide risk. The
  results suggest that region-specific changes in RNA editing of 5-HT2CR mRNA and
  deficient receptor function likely contribute to the etiology of major depressive
  disorder or suicide.
