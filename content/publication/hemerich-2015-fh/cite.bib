 abstract = {BACKGROUND: Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have
identified six single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) related to
carotid intima media thickness (cIMT) or plaque. However,
whether these loci relate to other vascular diseases and
subsequent vascular events is unclear. METHODS AND RESULTS: We
tested six SNPs (rs4888378, rs11781551, rs445925, rs6601530,
rs17398575 and rs1878406) for association with subclinical
atherosclerotic measures (cIMT, plaque presence and
ankle-brachial index), as well as ischemic stroke, abdominal
aortic aneurysm, peripheral or coronary artery disease (CAD) in
the Second Manifestations of ARTerial disease (SMART) cohort.
Four SNPs were associated with cIMT and two with plaque (p <
0.05). One SNP was also significantly associated to CAD
(rs1878406, OR = 1.24, 95% CI = 1.08-1.42, p = 2 $\times$
10(-3)). A genetic risk score (GRS) based on the cIMT-related
SNPs was associated to increased risk of cIMT itself (p = 1
$\times$ 10(-3)), but not to other secondary outcomes or
vascular events during follow-up (p = 0.86). CONCLUSIONS: In
addition to replicating previously published associations for
cIMT, we confirmed a nominally significant effect between the
GRS and cIMT.},
