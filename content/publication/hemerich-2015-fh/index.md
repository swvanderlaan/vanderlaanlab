abstract: "BACKGROUND: Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have identified
  six single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) related to carotid intima media
  thickness (cIMT) or plaque. However, whether these loci relate to other
  vascular diseases and subsequent vascular events is unclear. METHODS AND
  RESULTS: We tested six SNPs (rs4888378, rs11781551, rs445925, rs6601530,
  rs17398575 and rs1878406) for association with subclinical atherosclerotic
  measures (cIMT, plaque presence and ankle-brachial index), as well as ischemic
  stroke, abdominal aortic aneurysm, peripheral or coronary artery disease (CAD)
  in the Second Manifestations of ARTerial disease (SMART) cohort. Four SNPs
  were associated with cIMT and two with plaque (p < 0.05). One SNP was also
  significantly associated to CAD (rs1878406, OR = 1.24, 95% CI = 1.08-1.42, p =
  2 $times$ 10(-3)). A genetic risk score (GRS) based on the cIMT-related SNPs
  was associated to increased risk of cIMT itself (p = 1 $times$ 10(-3)), but
  not to other secondary outcomes or vascular events during follow-up (p =
  0.86). CONCLUSIONS: In addition to replicating previously published
  associations for cIMT, we confirmed a nominally significant effect between the
  GRS and cIMT."
