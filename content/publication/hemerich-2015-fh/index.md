abstract: 'BACKGROUND: Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have identified six
  single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) related to carotid intima media thickness
  (cIMT) or plaque. However, whether these loci relate to other vascular diseases
  and subsequent vascular events is unclear. METHODS AND RESULTS: We tested six SNPs
  (rs4888378, rs11781551, rs445925, rs6601530, rs17398575 and rs1878406) for association
  with subclinical atherosclerotic measures (cIMT, plaque presence and ankle-brachial
  index), as well as ischemic stroke, abdominal aortic aneurysm, peripheral or coronary
  artery disease (CAD) in the Second Manifestations of ARTerial disease (SMART) cohort.
  Four SNPs were associated with cIMT and two with plaque (p < 0.05). One SNP was
  also significantly associated to CAD (rs1878406, OR = 1.24, 95% CI = 1.08-1.42,
  p = 2 $times$ 10(-3)). A genetic risk score (GRS) based on the cIMT-related SNPs
  was associated to increased risk of cIMT itself (p = 1 $times$ 10(-3)), but not
  to other secondary outcomes or vascular events during follow-up (p = 0.86). CONCLUSIONS:
  In addition to replicating previously published associations for cIMT, we confirmed
  a nominally significant effect between the GRS and cIMT.'
