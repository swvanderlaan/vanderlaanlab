abstract: 'BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Family history (FHx) of cardiovascular disease (CVD)
  is a risk factor for CVD and a proxy for cardiovascular heritability. Polygenic
  risk scores (PRS) summarizing >1 million variants for coronary artery disease (CAD)
  are associated with incident and recurrent CAD events. However, little is known
  about the influence of FHx or PRS on secondary cardiovascular events (sCVE) in patients
  undergoing carotid endarterectomy (CEA). METHODS: We included 1788 CEA patients
  from the Athero-Express Biobank. A weighted PRS for CAD including 1.7 million variants
  was calculated (MetaGRS). The composite endpoint of sCVE during three years of follow-up
  included coronary, cerebrovascular and peripheral events and cardiovascular death.
  We assessed the impact of FHx and MetaGRS on sCVE and carotid plaque composition.
  RESULTS: Positive FHx was associated with a higher 3-year risk of sCVE independent
  of cardiovascular risk factors and MetaGRS (adjusted HR 1.40, 95%CI 1.07-1.82, p
  = 0.013). Patients in the highest MetaGRS quintile had a higher 3-year risk of sCVE
  compared to the rest of the cohort independent of cardiovascular risk factors including
  FHx (adjusted HR 1.35, 95%CI 1.01-1.79, p = 0.043), and their atherosclerotic plaques
  contained more fat (adjusted OR 1.59, 95%CI, 1.11-2.29, p = 0.013) and more macrophages
  (OR 1.49, 95%CI 1.12-1.99, p = 0.006). CONCLUSIONS: In CEA patients, both positive
  FHx and higher MetaGRS were independently associated with increased risk of sCVE.
  Moreover, higher MetaGRS was associated with vulnerable plaque characteristics.
  Future studies should unravel underlying mechanisms and focus on the added value
  of PRS and FHx in individual risk prediction for sCVE.'
