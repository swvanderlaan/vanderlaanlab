abstract: "BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Family history (FHx) of cardiovascular disease
  (CVD) is a risk factor for CVD and a proxy for cardiovascular heritability.
  Polygenic risk scores (PRS) summarizing >1 million variants for coronary
  artery disease (CAD) are associated with incident and recurrent CAD events.
  However, little is known about the influence of FHx or PRS on secondary
  cardiovascular events (sCVE) in patients undergoing carotid endarterectomy
  (CEA). METHODS: We included 1788 CEA patients from the Athero-Express Biobank.
  A weighted PRS for CAD including 1.7 million variants was calculated
  (MetaGRS). The composite endpoint of sCVE during three years of follow-up
  included coronary, cerebrovascular and peripheral events and cardiovascular
  death. We assessed the impact of FHx and MetaGRS on sCVE and carotid plaque
  composition. RESULTS: Positive FHx was associated with a higher 3-year risk of
  sCVE independent of cardiovascular risk factors and MetaGRS (adjusted HR 1.40,
  95%CI 1.07-1.82, p = 0.013). Patients in the highest MetaGRS quintile had a
  higher 3-year risk of sCVE compared to the rest of the cohort independent of
  cardiovascular risk factors including FHx (adjusted HR 1.35, 95%CI 1.01-1.79,
  p = 0.043), and their atherosclerotic plaques contained more fat (adjusted OR
  1.59, 95%CI, 1.11-2.29, p = 0.013) and more macrophages (OR 1.49, 95%CI
  1.12-1.99, p = 0.006). CONCLUSIONS: In CEA patients, both positive FHx and
  higher MetaGRS were independently associated with increased risk of sCVE.
  Moreover, higher MetaGRS was associated with vulnerable plaque
  characteristics. Future studies should unravel underlying mechanisms and focus
  on the added value of PRS and FHx in individual risk prediction for sCVE."
