 abstract = {BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Family history (FHx) of cardiovascular
disease (CVD) is a risk factor for CVD and a proxy for
cardiovascular heritability. Polygenic risk scores (PRS)
summarizing >1 million variants for coronary artery disease
(CAD) are associated with incident and recurrent CAD events.
However, little is known about the influence of FHx or PRS on
secondary cardiovascular events (sCVE) in patients undergoing
carotid endarterectomy (CEA). METHODS: We included 1788 CEA
patients from the Athero-Express Biobank. A weighted PRS for CAD
including 1.7 million variants was calculated (MetaGRS). The
composite endpoint of sCVE during three years of follow-up
included coronary, cerebrovascular and peripheral events and
cardiovascular death. We assessed the impact of FHx and MetaGRS
on sCVE and carotid plaque composition. RESULTS: Positive FHx
was associated with a higher 3-year risk of sCVE independent of
cardiovascular risk factors and MetaGRS (adjusted HR 1.40,
95%CI 1.07-1.82, p = 0.013). Patients in the highest MetaGRS
quintile had a higher 3-year risk of sCVE compared to the rest
of the cohort independent of cardiovascular risk factors
including FHx (adjusted HR 1.35, 95%CI 1.01-1.79, p = 0.043),
and their atherosclerotic plaques contained more fat (adjusted
OR 1.59, 95%CI, 1.11-2.29, p = 0.013) and more macrophages (OR
1.49, 95%CI 1.12-1.99, p = 0.006). CONCLUSIONS: In CEA
patients, both positive FHx and higher MetaGRS were
independently associated with increased risk of sCVE. Moreover,
higher MetaGRS was associated with vulnerable plaque
characteristics. Future studies should unravel underlying
mechanisms and focus on the added value of PRS and FHx in
individual risk prediction for sCVE.},
