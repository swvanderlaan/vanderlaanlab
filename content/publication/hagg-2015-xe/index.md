abstract: To date, genome-wide association studies (GWASs) have identified >100
  loci with single variants associated with body mass index (BMI). This approach
  may miss loci with high allelic heterogeneity; therefore, the aim of the
  present study was to use gene-based meta-analysis to identify regions with
  high allelic heterogeneity to discover additional obesity susceptibility loci.
  We included GWAS data from 123 865 individuals of European descent from 46
  cohorts in Stage 1 and Metabochip data from additional 103 046 individuals
  from 43 cohorts in Stage 2, all within the Genetic Investigation of
  ANthropometric Traits (GIANT) consortium. Each cohort was tested for
  association between ∼2.4 million (Stage 1) or ∼200 000 (Stage 2) imputed or
  genotyped single variants and BMI, and summary statistics were subsequently
  meta-analyzed in 17 941 genes. We used the 'VErsatile Gene-based Association
  Study' (VEGAS) approach to assign variants to genes and to calculate
  gene-based P-values based on simulations. The VEGAS method was applied to each
  cohort separately before a gene-based meta-analysis was performed. In Stage 1,
  two known (FTO and TMEM18) and six novel (PEX2, MTFR2, SSFA2, IARS2, CEP295
  and TXNDC12) loci were associated with BMI (P < 2.8 $times$ 10(-6) for 17 941
  gene tests). We confirmed all loci, and six of them were gene-wide significant
  in Stage 2 alone. We provide biological support for the loci by pathway,
  expression and methylation analyses. Our results indicate that gene-based
  meta-analysis of GWAS provides a useful strategy to find loci of interest that
  were not identified in standard single-marker analyses due to high allelic
  heterogeneity.
