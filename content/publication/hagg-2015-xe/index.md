abstract: To date, genome-wide association studies (GWASs) have identified >100 loci
  with single variants associated with body mass index (BMI). This approach may miss
  loci with high allelic heterogeneity; therefore, the aim of the present study was
  to use gene-based meta-analysis to identify regions with high allelic heterogeneity
  to discover additional obesity susceptibility loci. We included GWAS data from 123
  865 individuals of European descent from 46 cohorts in Stage 1 and Metabochip data
  from additional 103 046 individuals from 43 cohorts in Stage 2, all within the Genetic
  Investigation of ANthropometric Traits (GIANT) consortium. Each cohort was tested
  for association between ∼2.4 million (Stage 1) or ∼200 000 (Stage 2) imputed or
  genotyped single variants and BMI, and summary statistics were subsequently meta-analyzed
  in 17 941 genes. We used the 'VErsatile Gene-based Association Study' (VEGAS) approach
  to assign variants to genes and to calculate gene-based P-values based on simulations.
  The VEGAS method was applied to each cohort separately before a gene-based meta-analysis
  was performed. In Stage 1, two known (FTO and TMEM18) and six novel (PEX2, MTFR2,
  SSFA2, IARS2, CEP295 and TXNDC12) loci were associated with BMI (P < 2.8 $times$
  10(-6) for 17 941 gene tests). We confirmed all loci, and six of them were gene-wide
  significant in Stage 2 alone. We provide biological support for the loci by pathway,
  expression and methylation analyses. Our results indicate that gene-based meta-analysis
  of GWAS provides a useful strategy to find loci of interest that were not identified
  in standard single-marker analyses due to high allelic heterogeneity.
