 abstract = {To date, genome-wide association studies (GWASs) have identified
>100 loci with single variants associated with body mass index
(BMI). This approach may miss loci with high allelic
heterogeneity; therefore, the aim of the present study was to
use gene-based meta-analysis to identify regions with high
allelic heterogeneity to discover additional obesity
susceptibility loci. We included GWAS data from 123 865
individuals of European descent from 46 cohorts in Stage 1 and
Metabochip data from additional 103 046 individuals from 43
cohorts in Stage 2, all within the Genetic Investigation of
ANthropometric Traits (GIANT) consortium. Each cohort was tested
for association between ∼2.4 million (Stage 1) or ∼200 000
(Stage 2) imputed or genotyped single variants and BMI, and
summary statistics were subsequently meta-analyzed in 17 941
genes. We used the 'VErsatile Gene-based Association Study'
(VEGAS) approach to assign variants to genes and to calculate
gene-based P-values based on simulations. The VEGAS method was
applied to each cohort separately before a gene-based
meta-analysis was performed. In Stage 1, two known (FTO and
TMEM18) and six novel (PEX2, MTFR2, SSFA2, IARS2, CEP295 and
TXNDC12) loci were associated with BMI (P < 2.8 $\times$ 10(-6)
for 17 941 gene tests). We confirmed all loci, and six of them
were gene-wide significant in Stage 2 alone. We provide
biological support for the loci by pathway, expression and
methylation analyses. Our results indicate that gene-based
meta-analysis of GWAS provides a useful strategy to find loci of
interest that were not identified in standard single-marker
analyses due to high allelic heterogeneity.},
