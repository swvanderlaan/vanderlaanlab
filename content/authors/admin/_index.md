I am an assistant professor in the [Central Diagnostics Laboratory](https://www.umcutrecht.nl/en/Subsites/UMC-Utrecht-Lab/About-us/Laboratory-of-Clinical-Chemistry-Haematology) which is part of the [Circulatory Health Program](https://www.umcutrecht.nl/en/Research/Strategic-themes/Circulatory-Health) at the University Medical Center Utrecht and University of Utrecht. My research interest is focused on the genetic and epigenetic causes of carotid and coronary atherosclerosis underlying *ischemic stroke (IS)* and *coronary artery disease (CAD)*, and their intermediate traits such as *carotid intima media thickness (cIMT)* and *arterial calcification*. 

My vision is that this holistic approach will identify the truly viable targets to feed the drug developmental pipeline to combat the cardiovascular disease epidemic. This approach is human centered and does not involved new *in vivo* experiments.

I actively contribute to the [International Stroke Genetics Consortium](http://www.strokegenetics.org/). In addition, I make contributions to international consortia, including [GENIUS-CHD](http://www.genius-chd.com/), [GIANT](http://portals.broadinstitute.org/collaboration/giant/index.php/GIANT_consortium), [GLGC](http://lipidgenetics.org/), [GoDMC](http://www.godmc.org.uk/), and various other international consortia.

I am a Review Editor for Frontiers in Cardiovascular Epidemiology and Prevention and Frontiers in Human Genomics.
