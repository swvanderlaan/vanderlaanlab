Daniëlle work as an intern with Sander when he was a PhD student. She worked on the effects of single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) near _FABP4_ on _FABP4_ expression in carotid plaques. After successfully finishing here studies her career took her via Cardialysis to AbbVie where she now holds a position as Senior Research Associate.
