Heleen joined our lab in 2018 for an internship combining multiple dataset to identify druggable targets. After successfully finishing her studies at the HAN, she moved on to Leiden University for a MSc in Computer Science and Bioinformatics. She was a great intern that handle complex biological and 'omics' matter quickly to work on the CardioTargetIdentifier. A great addition to the team.
