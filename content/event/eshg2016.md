**Background** Tens of genetic susceptibility loci associate with large artery ischemic stroke (LAS) and coronary artery disease (CAD), but deciphering their underlying mechanisms to identify putative therapeutic targets is challenging. Atherosclerosis is cardinal to cardiovascular diseases (CVD) and histological studies have identified plaque characteristics that associate with clinical outcome. To what extent common variation associated with CVD relates to these characteristics remains unknown. We studied the impact of sequence variation on plaque characteristics, and tissue-specific gene expression by combining data from independent biobanks comprising patients with clinically significant arterial stenosis. </br></br>
**Methods** We genotyped 1,439 patients from Athero-Express, 127 patients from BiKE, and 109 patients from STAGE. We tested 61 CVD susceptibility loci for association to seven plaque characteristics, and gene expression using regression modeling, correcting for age, sex, 10 principal components, and study specific covariates. </br></br>
**Results** We report a ~5.2-fold enrichment of CAD variants associated with plaque characteristics (p = 3.6x10<sup>-8</sup>, 16 out of 61 variants). The CAD risk reducing alleles of rs12539895 and a nearby deletion (chr7:106,901,393 TG > T) on 7q22 associated with less fat in plaques (p < 5.1x10<sup>-6</sup>), and lower circulating LDL levels. Circularized chromosome conformation capture in monocytes revealed many regional genes physically interacting with rs12539895. Additional analyses revealed tissue-specific effects on *HBP1*, *COG5*, and *GPR22* expression, further prioritizing the list of 11 regional genes for future studies.</br></br>
**Conclusion** Our study supports the view that genetic loci conferring susceptibility to CAD and LAS, play a role in the underlying pathophysiology of the atherosclerotic plaque.
