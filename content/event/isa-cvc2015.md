**Background** Observational studies show a strong dose-rsponse association between circulating cystatin C (encoded by CST3) and incident coronary heart disease (CHD), independent of traditional risk factors and renal function. This supports the hypothesis that circulating cystatin C could represent a causal factor for CHD. However, residual confounding and reverse causality could be alternative explanations that are difficult to tease from observational studies. We sought to investigate the causal role of cystatin C in CHD development by conducting a Mendelian randomization (MR) analysis using a common variant in the *CST3* locus.</br></br>
**Methods** We incorporated data from population-based prospective studies (17 cohorts with 77,501 individuals) with 37,808 measures of cystatin C and added genetic association data from 28 additional datasets (n=123,766) from the CARDIoGRAM, METASTROKE, and CHARGE consortia to yield a total combined sample size of 201,267 individuals including 41,229 CHD events. We used a common variant (rs911119) in *CST3* as a genetic instrument for cystatin C to investigate its causal role in CHD.</br></br>
**Results** Cystatin C associated with risk of CHD in an observational analysis adjusted for age and sex (odds ratio [OR] 2.20; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.90, 2.57 per doubling of cystatin C concentration; p=8.87x10<sup>-31</sup>); additional adjustment for confounders (smoking, HDL-cholesterol, BMI, CKD-EPI, and systolic blood pressure) diminished the association (OR 1.60; 95%CI 1.34, 1.96 per doubling of cystatin C concentration; p=9.09x10<sup>-7</sup>). Rs911119 was associated with a decrease on circulating cystatin C levels (5.94% per minor allele; 95%CI 5.51, 6.36; p=4.49x10<sup>-149</sup>), explaining 2.8% of the phenotypic variation. However, the variant did not show significant association with risk of CHD (OR 1.01 (95%CI 0.99, 1.03; p=0.41). Using Mendelian randomization, no causal effect of cystatin C on CHD risk was identified (OR 1.10 per doubling cystatin-C; 95%CI 0.86, 1.41, p=0.459), even though we had >90% power to detect. A causal effect for cystatin C was not identified for any other cardiovascular outcome.</br></br>
**Conclusions** We identified no causal relationship between cystatin C and CVD outcomes. Therapeutics aimed at lowering cystatin-C should not be prioritized for randomized clinical trials of CHD prevention.
