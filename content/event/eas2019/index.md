summary: Van der Laan Lab attends EAS 2019.
abstract: "Here we presented on different parts of our work. [Nathalie](authors/nathalietimmerman/_index.md) presented [family history in the context of plaque morphology](https://twitter.com/swvanderlaan/status/1275320517260689410?s=20). [Constance](authors/constancevanlaarhoven/_index.md) presented on [our work](https://twitter.com/swvanderlaan/status/1133390367338958848) with [polygenic scores and abdominal sac diameter](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-019-56230-3). We also showed [our (now published) work](https://doi.org/10.1093/ehjopen/oeab043) employing [single-cell RNA sequencing data from carotid plaques](https://doi.org/10.1161/CIRCRESAHA.120.316770) to drill down on GWAS loci."
