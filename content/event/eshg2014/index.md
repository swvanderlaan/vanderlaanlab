**Background** Observational studies show a strong dose-rsponse association between circulating Cystatin C (encoded by *CST3*) and incident coronary heart disease (CHD), independent of traditional risk factors and renal function. This supports the hypothesis that circulating Cystatin C could represent a causal factor for CHD. However, residual confounding and reverse causality could be alternative explanations that are difficult to tease from observational studies. We sought to investigate the causal role of Cystatin C in CHD development by conducting a Mendelian randomization (MR) analysis using a common variant in the *CST3* locus.</br></br>
**Methods** We conducted a MR analysis in 43 studies including 219,219 individuals with 37,321 measures of Cystatin C and 41,162 CHD events. We used rs911119 (or a proxy, r2>0.90) in the *CST3* locus (identified previously by GWAS) as a genetic instrument for MR analysis.</br></br>
**Results** Cystatin C associated with risk of CHD in an observational analysis adjusted for age and sex (odds ratio [OR] 2.20; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.90, 2.57 per doubling of Cystatin C concentration; p=8.87×10<sup>-31</sup>); additional adjustment for confounders (smoking, HDL-cholesterol, BMI, CKD-EPI, and systolic blood pressure) diminished the association (OR 1.60; 95%CI 1.34, 1.96 per doubling of Cystatin C concentration; p=9.09×10<sup>-7</sup>). Rs911119 had a strong effect on circulating Cystatin C levels (-0.061; 95%CI -0.066, -0.057; p=4.49×10<sup>-149</sup> per effect allele). However, the variant did not show significant association with risk of CHD (OR 1.01 (95%CI 0.99, 1.03; p=0.41).</br></br>
**Conclusion** In summary we replicated the association of Cystatin C with CHD risk and show a strong association of rs911119 with circulating Cystatin C. However, we find no evidence for a causal role of Cystatin C in the development of CHD.
