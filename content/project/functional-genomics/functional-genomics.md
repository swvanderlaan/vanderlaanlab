In the post-GWAS world the major efforts should focus on 'translating' genetic discoveries to tangible 'products', be it truly novel drugs, a re-design of existing therapeutic strategies, stratified (tailored) clinical trials, or policy making and lifestyle advise. In our lab we contribute to these efforts by developing methods and creating resources to further deep-phenotype atherosclerotic plaques, and following-up specific genetic loci through _in silico_ fine-mapping and colocalization, as well as _in vitro_ experiments.
